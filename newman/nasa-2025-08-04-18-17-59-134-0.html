The wedge-shaped cosmic cloudlet lies within a relatively crowded region of space though. About 7,000 light-years distant and filled with glowing gas and an embedded cluster of young stars, the region is known as M16 or the Eagle Nebula. Hubble&#x27;s iconic images of the Eagle Nebula include the famous star-forming Pillars of Creation, towering structures of interstellar gas and dust 4 to 5 light-years long. But this small dark nebula, known to some as a Bok globule, is a fraction of a light-year across. The Bok globule stands out in silhouette against the expansive background of M16&#x27;s diffuse glow. Found scattered within emission nebulae and star clusters, Bok globules are small interstellar clouds of cold molecular gas and obscuring dust that also form stars within their dense, collapsing cores.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2508/BokGlobule_1.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Small Dark Nebula&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2508/BokGlobule_1_1024.jpg&quot;}

Discovered in 2022 by amateur astronomers, the faint arcs -- dubbed SDSO 1 -- span nearly the same angular size as M31 itself.  At first, their origin was a mystery: are they actually near the Andromeda Galaxy, or alternatively near to our Sun?  Now, over 550 hours of combined exposure and a collaboration between amateur and professional astronomers has revealed strong evidence for their true nature: SDSO 1 is not intergalactic, but a new class of planetary nebula within our galaxy.  Dubbed a Ghost Planetary Nebula (GPN), SDSO 1 is the first recognized member of a new subclass of faded planetary nebulas, along with seven others also recently identified.  Shown in blue are extremely faint oxygen emission from the shock waves, while the surrounding red is a hydrogen-emitting trail that indicates the GPN&#x27;s age.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2508/M31Oxy_Collab_5415.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Blue Arcs Toward Andromeda&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2508/M31Oxy_Collab_960.jpg&quot;}

The wedge-shaped cosmic cloudlet lies within a relatively crowded region of space though. About 7,000 light-years distant and filled with glowing gas and an embedded cluster of young stars, the region is known as M16 or the Eagle Nebula. Hubble&#x27;s iconic images of the Eagle Nebula include the famous star-forming Pillars of Creation, towering structures of interstellar gas and dust 4 to 5 light-years long. But this small dark nebula, known to some as a Bok globule, is a fraction of a light-year across. The Bok globule stands out in silhouette against the expansive background of M16&#x27;s diffuse glow. Found scattered within emission nebulae and star clusters, Bok globules are small interstellar clouds of cold molecular gas and obscuring dust that also form stars within their dense, collapsing cores.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2508/BokGlobule_1.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Small Dark Nebula&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2508/BokGlobule_1_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Daniel Korona&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-08-02&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Taken on July 29 and July 30, a registered and stacked series of exposures creates this dreamlike view of a northern summer night. Multiple firefly flashes streak across the foreground as the luminous Milky Way arcs above the horizon in the Sierra de \u00d3rganos national park of central Mexico. The collection of bright streaks aligned across the sky toward the upper left in the timelapse image are Delta Aquariid meteors. Currently active, the annual Delta Aquariid meteor shower shares August nights though, overlapping with the better-known Perseid meteor shower. This year that makes post-midnight, mostly moonless skies in early August very popular with late night skygazers. How can you tell a Delta Aquariid from a Perseid meteor?  The streaks of Perseid meteors can be traced back to an apparent radiant in the constellation Perseus. Delta Aquariids appear to emerge from the more southerly constellation Aquarius, beyond the top left of this frame. Of course, the bioluminescent flashes of fireflies are common too on these northern summer nights. But how can you tell a firefly from a meteor? Just try to catch one.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2508/DeltaAqrFireflies.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Fireflies, Meteors, and Milky Way&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2508/DeltaAqrFireflies1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nAndre van der Hoeven\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-08-03&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;In about a week the Perseid Meteor Shower will reach its maximum.  Grains of icy rock will streak across the sky as they evaporate during entry into Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.  These grains were shed from Comet Swift-Tuttle.  The Perseids result from the annual crossing of the Earth through Comet Swift-Tuttle&#x27;s orbit, and are typically the most active meteor shower of the year.  Although it is hard to predict the level of activity in any meteor shower, in a clear dark sky an observer might see a meteor a minute.  This year&#x27;s Perseids peak just a few days after  full moon, and so some faint meteors will be lost to the lunar skyglow.  Meteor showers in general are best seen from a relaxing position, away from lights.  Featured here is a meteor caught exploding during the 2015 Perseids above Austria next to the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2508/MeteorBoom_vanderHoeven_750.gif&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Milky Way and Exploding Meteor&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2508/MeteorBoom_vanderHoeven_750.gif&quot;}]

Mercury. Possibly the clearest view of Mercury crossing in front of the Sun in 2016 May was from Earth orbit. The Solar Dynamics Observatory obtained an uninterrupted vista recording it not only in optical light but also in bands of ultraviolet light. Featured here is a composite movie of the crossing set to music. Although the event might prove successful scientifically for better determining components of Mercury&#x27; ultra-thin atmosphere, the event surely proved successful culturally by involving people throughout the world in observing a rare astronomical phenomenon. Many spectacular images of this Mercury transit from around (and above) the globe were proudly displayed. The next transit of Mercury will take place in three weeks: on 2019 November 11.

The spot was first noticed last year by the robot Cassini spacecraft now orbiting Saturn.  Cassini&#x27;s flyby of Rhea in April imaged in the spot in great detail.  Astronomers hypothesize that the light-colored spot is the result of a relatively recent impact on the surface of the icy moon.  The impact that likely created the crater also splashed light-colored material from the interior onto the darker surface.  Rhea spans 1,500 kilometers across and is the second largest moon of Saturn after Titan.  Rhea sports several other light colored surface features that are, as yet, not well understood.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0505/rheaspot_cassini_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;A Great White Spot on Rhea&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0505/rheaspot_cassini.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-08-11&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Where do Perseid meteors come from? Mostly small bits of stony grit, Perseid meteoroids were once expelled from Comet Swift-Tuttle and continue to follow this comet&#x27;s orbit as they slowly disperse.  The featured animation depicts the entire meteoroid stream as it orbits our Sun.  When the Earth nears this stream, as it does every year, the Perseid Meteor Shower occurs.  Highlighted as bright in the animation, comet debris this size is usually so dim it is practically undetectable.  Only a small fraction of this debris will enter the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, heat up and disintegrate brightly.  Tonight and the next few nights promise some of the better skies to view the Perseid shower as well as other active showers because the first quarter moon will be absent from the sky from midnight onward.

(post 1995)&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;video&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Animation: Perseid Meteor Shower&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.meteorshowers.org/view/perseids&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nDario Giannobile\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2019-03-04&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;This was a sunrise to remember. About a month ago, just before the dawn of the Sun, an impressive alignment of celestial objects was on display to the east. Pictured, brightest and closest to the horizon, is the Moon. The Moon&#x27;s orange glow is caused by the scattering away of blue light by the intervening atmosphere. Next brightest and next closest to the horizon is the planet Venus.  Compared to the Moon, Venus appears more blue -- as can (also) be seen in its reflection from the water. Next up is Jupiter, while the bright object above Jupiter is the star Antares.  Although this display was visible from almost anywhere on planet Earth, the featured image was taken along a picturesque seashore near the city of Syracuse, on the island of Sicily, in the country of Italy. This month Saturn appears between Venus and Jupiter before sunrise, while Mars is visible just after sunset.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1903/MoonPlanetsStar_Giannobile_1313.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Celestial Alignment over Sicilian Shore&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1903/MoonPlanetsStar_Giannobile_1313_annotated.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-11-01&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Why is the Lobster Nebula forming some of the most massive stars known? No one is yet sure.  Cataloged as NGC 6357, the Lobster Nebula houses the open star cluster Pismis 24 near its center -- a home to unusually bright and massive stars.  The overall red glow near the inner star forming region results from the emission of ionized hydrogen gas.   The surrounding nebula, featured here, holds a complex tapestry of gas, dark dust, stars still forming, and newly born stars.  The intricate patterns are caused by complex interactions between interstellar winds, radiation pressures, magnetic fields, and gravity.  The image was taken with DOE&#x27;s Dark Energy Camera on the 4-meter Blanco Telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile.

Now on a return voyage to the distant Oort Cloud, the Halley-type comet is recorded here sweeping through northern summer night skies over historic Kunetice Castle, Czech Republic. The composite of tracked exposures for comet and sky, showing the comet&#x27;s broad dust tail, brighter coma, and long ion tail buffeted by storms and winds from the Sun, and fixed exposures for foreground landscape was recorded on July 28. The comet is about 16 light-minutes beyond the castle and seen against faint background stars below the northern constellation Ursa Major. The hilltop castle dates to the 15th century, while Heinrich Olbers discovered the comet in 1815. Captured here low in northwestern skies just after sunset Comet Olbers, for now, offers skywatchers on planet Earth rewarding telescopic and binocular views. Comet 13P/Olbers&#x27; next perihelion passage will be in 2094.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2408/2024_07_28_Olbers_Kunka_Kunetice_1500px.png&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Comet Olbers over Kunetice Castle&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2408/2024_07_28_Olbers_Kunka_Kunetice_1024px.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Tunc Tezel&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-08-02&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;As Mars wanders through Earth&#x27;s night, it passes about 5 degrees south of the Pleiades star cluster in this composite astrophoto. The skyview was constructed from a series of images captured over a run of 16 consecutive clear nights beginning on July 12. Mars&#x27; march across the field of view begins at the far right, the planet&#x27;s ruddy hue showing a nice contrast with the blue Pleiades stars. Moving much faster across the sky against the distant stars, the fourth planet from the Sun easily passes seventh planet Uranus. Red planet Mars and the ice giant world were in close conjunction, about 1/2 degree apart, on July 16. Continuing its rapid eastward trek, Mars has now left the sister stars and outer planet behind though, passing north of red giant star Aldebaran. Mars will come within about 1/3 degree of Jupiter in planet Earth&#x27;s sky on August 14.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2408/2024MaUrM45.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Mars Passing By&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2408/2024MaUrM45_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Cem \u00d6zkeser&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-08-03&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;On a road trip up Mount Uluda\u011f in Bursa province, Turkey these motorcyclists found themselves above low clouds and fog in late June. With the bright Sun directly behind them, the view down the side of the great mountain revealed a beautiful, atmospheric glory and fog bow. Known to some as the heiligenschein or the Specter of the Brocken, a glory can also sometimes be seen from airplanes or even high buildings. It often appears to be a dark giant surrounded by a bright halo. Of course the dark giant is just the shadow of the observer (90MB video) cast opposite the Sun. The clouds and fog are composed of very small water droplets, smaller than rain drops, that refract and reflect sunlight to create the glory&#x27;s colorful halo and this more extensive fog bow.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2408/GloryFog1.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Glory and Fog Bow&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2408/GloryFog_label.png&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-08-04&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;What would it look like to return home from outside our galaxy? Although designed to answer greater questions, data from ESA&#x27;s robotic Gaia mission is helping to provide a uniquely modern perspective on humanity&#x27;s place in the universe.  Gaia orbits the Sun near the Earth and resolves stars&#x27; positions so precisely that it can determine a slight shift from its changing vantage point over the course of a year, a shift that is proportionately smaller for more distant stars -- and so determines distance.  In the first sequence of the video, an illustration of the Milky Way is shown that soon resolves into a three-dimensional visualization of Gaia star data.  A few notable stars are labelled with their common names, while others stars are labelled with numbers from a Gaia catalog. Eventually, the viewer arrives in our stellar neighborhood where many stars were tracked by Gaia, and soon at our home star Sol, the Sun. At the video&#x27;s end, the reflective glow of Sol&#x27;s third planet becomes visible: Earth.&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;video&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Gaia: Here Comes the Sun&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XORui0wFKnE?rel&#x3D;0&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nMakrem Larnaout\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-08-05&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;That&#x27;s no moon. On the ground, that&#x27;s the Lars Homestead in Tunisia. And that&#x27;s not just any galaxy. That&#x27;s the central band of our own Milky Way galaxy. Last, that&#x27;s not just any meteor. It is a bright fireball likely from last year&#x27;s Perseids meteor shower. The featured image composite combines consecutive exposures taken by the same camera from the same location.  This year&#x27;s Perseids peak during the coming weekend is expected to show the most meteors after the first quarter moon sets, near midnight.  To best experience a meteor shower, you should have clear and dark skies, a comfortable seat, and patience.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2408/LarsMilkyWay_Larnaout_2048.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Milky Way Over Tunisia&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2408/LarsMilkyWay_Larnaout_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nLaura Rowe (Used with permission) \n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-08-06&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;What makes this storm cloud so colorful?  First, the cloud itself is composed of millions of tiny droplets of water and ice.  Its bottom is almost completely flat -- but this isn&#x27;t unusual.  Bottom flatness in clouds is generally caused by air temperature dropping as you go up, and that above a specific height, water-saturated air condenses out water droplets.  The shape of the cloud middle is caused by a water-droplet-laden column of air being blown upward.  Most unusual, though, are the orange and yellow colors.  Both colors are caused by the cloud&#x27;s water drops reflecting sunlight. The orange color in the cloud&#x27;s middle and bottom sections are reflections of a nearly red sunset.  In contrast, the yellow color of the cloud&#x27;s top results from reflection of light from a not-yet-setting Sun, where some -- but less -- blue light is being scattered away. Appearing to float above the plains in Texas, the featured impressive image of a dynamic cumulonimbus cloud was captured in 2021 while investigating a tornado.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2408/StormCloud_Rowe_960.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Storm Cloud Over Texas&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2408/StormCloud_Rowe_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nDonato Lioce; \nText: Natalia Lewandowska \n(SUNY Oswego)\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-08-07&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;To some, they look like battlements, here protecting us against the center of the Milky Way. The Three Merlons, also called the Three Peaks of Lavaredo, stand tall today because they are made of dense dolomite rock which has better resisted erosion than surrounding softer rock. They formed about 250 million years ago and so are comparable in age with one of the great extinctions of life on Earth. A leading hypothesis is that this great extinction was triggered by an asteroid about 10-km across, larger in size than Mount Everest, impacting the Earth. Humans have gazed up at the stars in the Milky Way and beyond for centuries, making these battlefield-like formations, based in the Sexten Dolomites, a popular place for current and ancient astronomers.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2408/DolomitesSky_Lioce_4681.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Milky Way Behind Three Merlons&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2408/DolomitesSky_Lioce_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Gerald Rhemann&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-08-08&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;A Halley-type comet with an orbital period of about 133 years, Comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle is recognized as the parent of the annual Perseid Meteor Shower. The comet&#x27;s last visit to the inner Solar System was in 1992. Then, it did not become easily visible to the naked eye, but it did become bright enough to see from most locations with binoculars and small telescopes. This stunning color image of Swift-Tuttle&#x27;s greenish coma, long ion tail and dust tail was recorded using film on November 24, 1992. That was about 16 days after the large periodic comet&#x27;s closest approach to Earth. Comet Swift-Tuttle is expected to next make an impressive appearance in night skies in 2126. Meanwhile, dusty cometary debris left along the orbit of Swift-Tuttle will continue to be swept up creating planet Earth&#x27;s best-known July and August meteor shower.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2408/Rhemann799_109P_24_11_92.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Periodic Comet Swift-Tuttle&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2408/Rhemann799_109P_24_11_92_1100px.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-08-09&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Denizens of planet Earth typically watch meteor showers by looking up. But this remarkable view, captured on August 13, 2011 by astronaut Ron Garan, caught a Perseid meteor by looking down. From Garan&#x27;s perspective on board the International Space Station orbiting at an altitude of about 380 kilometers, the Perseid meteors streak below, swept up dust from comet Swift-Tuttle. The vaporizing comet dust grains are traveling at about 60 kilometers per second through the denser atmosphere around 100 kilometers above Earth&#x27;s surface. In this case, the foreshortened meteor flash is near frame center, below the curving limb of the Earth and a layer of greenish airglow, just below bright star Arcturus. Want to look up at a meteor shower?  You&#x27;re in luck, as the 2024 Perseid meteor shower is active now and predicted to peak near August 12. With interfering bright moonlight absent, this year you&#x27;ll likely see many Perseid meteors under clear, dark skies after midnight.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2408/perseid_iss_4256.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;A Perseid Below&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2408/perseid_iss_4256_1024c.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Robert Edelmaier and Gabriele Gegenbauer&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-08-10&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Messier 20, popularly known as the Trifid Nebula, lies about 5,000 light-years away toward the nebula rich constellation Sagittarius. A star forming region in the plane of our galaxy, the Trifid does illustrate three different types of astronomical nebulae; red emission nebulae dominated by light from hydrogen atoms, blue reflection nebulae produced by dust reflecting starlight, and dark nebulae where dense dust clouds appear in silhouette. The reddish emission region, roughly separated into three parts by obscuring dust lanes, is what lends the Trifid its popular name. The cosmic cloud complex is over 40 light-years across and would cover the area of a full moon on planet Earth&#x27;s sky. But the Trifid Nebula is too faint to be seen by the unaided eye. Over 75 hours of image data captured under dark night skies was used to create this stunning telescopic view.

Mostly small bits of stony grit, Perseid meteoroids were once expelled from Comet Swift-Tuttle and continue to follow this comet&#x27;s orbit as they slowly disperse.  The featured animation depicts the entire meteoroid stream as it orbits our Sun.  When the Earth nears this stream, as it does every year, the Perseid Meteor Shower occurs.  Highlighted as bright in the animation, comet debris this size is usually so dim it is practically undetectable.  Only a small fraction of this debris will enter the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, heat up and disintegrate brightly.  Tonight and the next few nights promise some of the better skies to view the Perseid shower as well as other active showers because the first quarter moon will be absent from the sky from midnight onward.

A meteor shower: specifically, the Perseid meteor shower. A few nights ago, after the sky darkened, many images of meteors from this year&#x27;s Perseids were captured separately and merged into a single frame. Although the meteors all traveled on straight paths, these paths appear slightly curved by the wide-angle lens of the capturing camera. The meteor streaks can all be traced back to a single point on the sky called the radiant, here just off the top of the frame in the constellation of Perseus. The same camera took a deep image of the background sky that brought up the central band of our Milky Way galaxy running nearly vertical through the image center. The featured image was taken from Wiltshire, England, being careful to include, at the bottom, the famous astronomical monument of Stonehenge. Although the Perseids peaked last night, some Perseid meteors should still be visible for a few more nights.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2408/PerseidsStonehenge_Dury_2780.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Perseid Meteors over Stonehenge&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2408/PerseidsStonehenge_Dury_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-08-13&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;What&#x27;s that on the horizon? When circling the Earth on the International Space Station early last month, astronaut Matthew Dominick saw an unusual type of lightning just beyond the Earth&#x27;s edge: a gigantic jet. The powerful jet appears on the left of the featured image in red and blue. Giant jet lightning has only been known about for the past 23 years. The atmospheric jets are associated with thunderstorms and extend upwards towards Earth&#x27;s ionosphere.  The lower part of the frame shows the Earth at night, with Earth&#x27;s thin atmosphere tinted green from airglow. City lights are visible, sometimes resolved, but usually creating diffuse white glows in intervening clouds.  The top of the frame reveals distant stars in the dark night sky. The nature of gigantic jets and their possible association with other types of Transient Luminous Events (TLEs) such as blue jets and red sprites remains an active topic of research.

For one thing, the night sky of August 11 and 12, earlier this week, occurred near the peak of the annual Perseid Meteor Shower. Therefore, meteors streaked across the dark night as small bits cast off from Comet Swift-Tuttle came crashing into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Even more unusually, for central Germany at least, the night sky glowed purple. The red-blue hue was due to aurora caused by an explosion of particles from the Sun a few days before. This auroral storm was so intense that it was seen as far south as Texas and Italy, in Earth&#x27;s northern hemisphere.  The featured image composite was built from 7 exposures taken over 26 minutes from Ense, Germany. The Perseids occur predictably every August, but auroras visible this far south are more unusual and less predictable.

Taken on August 12 during a geomagnetic storm, the snapshot records the glow of aurora borealis or northern lights, beaming from the left side of the frame. Of course on that date Perseid meteors rained through planet Earth&#x27;s skies, grains of dust from the shower&#x27;s parent, periodic comet Swift-Tuttle. The meteor streak at the upper right is a Perseid plowing through the atmosphere at about 60 kilometers per second. Also well-known in Earth&#x27;s night sky, the bright Pleiades star cluster shines below the Perseid meteor streak. In Greek myth, the Pleiades were seven daughters of the astronomical titan Atlas and sea-nymph Pleione. The Pleiades and their parents&#x27; names are given to the cluster&#x27;s nine brightest stars.

It appears to cross the stars of the Big Dipper, famous northern asterism and celestial kitchen utensil, while shimmering curtains of aurora borealis, also known as the northern lights, dance in the night. Doubling the wow factor for night skywatchers near the peak of this year&#x27;s Perseid meteor shower auroral activity on planet Earth was enhanced by geomagnetic storms. The intense space weather was triggered by flares from an active Sun.

The fiery trace of the Electron&#x27;s graceful launch arc is toward the east in this southern sea and skyscape, a composite of 50 consecutive frames taken over 2.5 hours. Fixed to a tripod, the camera was pointing directly at the South Celestial Pole, the extension of planet Earth&#x27;s axis of rotation in to space. But no bright star marks that location in the southern hemisphere&#x27;s night sky. Still, the South Celestial Pole is easy to spot.

In 2011, NASA&#x27;s Sun-orbiting Solar Dynamic Observatory spacecraft imaged an impressively large prominence erupting from the surface. The dramatic explosion was captured in ultraviolet light in the featured time lapse video covering 90 minutes, where a new frame was taken every 24 seconds.  The scale of the prominence is huge -- the entire Earth would easily fit under the flowing  curtain of hot gas.  A solar prominence is channeled and sometimes held above the Sun&#x27;s surface by the Sun&#x27;s magnetic field. A quiescent prominence typically lasts about a month and may erupt in a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) expelling hot gas into the Solar System.  The energy mechanism that creates a solar prominence is a continuing topic of research.  Our Sun is again near solar maximum and so very active, featuring numerous erupting prominences and CMEs, one of which resulted in picturesque auroras just over the past week.&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;video&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;A Solar Prominence Eruption from SDO&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PBL1RBj-P1g?rel&#x3D;0&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nLuis Romero Ventura\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-08-19&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Inside the Cocoon Nebula is a newly developing cluster of stars. Cataloged as IC 5146, the beautiful nebula is nearly 15 light-years wide. Soaring high in northern summer night skies, it&#x27;s located some 4,000 light years away toward the constellation of the Swan (Cygnus).  Like other star forming regions, it stands out in red, glowing, hydrogen gas excited by young, hot stars, and dust-reflected starlight at the edge of an otherwise invisible molecular cloud.  In fact, the bright star found near the center of this nebula is likely only a few hundred thousand years old, powering the nebular glow as it clears out a cavity in the molecular cloud&#x27;s star forming dust and gas. A 48-hour long integration resulted in this exceptionally deep color view tracing tantalizing features within and surrounding the dusty stellar nursery.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2408/Cocoon_Ventura_2047.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;IC 5146: The Cocoon Nebula&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2408/Cocoon_Ventura_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-08-20&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;A supermoon occurred yesterday. And tonight&#x27;s moon should also look impressive.  Supermoons appear slightly larger and brighter than most full moons because they reach their full phase when slightly nearer to the Earth -- closer than 90 percent of all full moons.  This supermoon was also a blue moon given the definition that it is the third of four full moons occurring during a single season.  Blue moons are not usually blue, and a different definition holds that a blue moon is the second full moon that occurs during a single month.  The featured image captured the blue supermoon right near its peak size yesterday as it was rising beyond the Temple of Poseidon in Greece. This supermoon is particularly unusual in that it is the first of four successive supermoons, the next three occurring in September, October, and November.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2408/SupermoonPoseidon_Maragos_1601.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Supermoon Beyond the Temple of Poseidon&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2408/SupermoonPoseidon_Maragos_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-08-21&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Forget X-ray vision \u2014 imagine what you could see with gamma-ray vision!  The featured all-sky map shows what the universe looks like to NASA&#x27;s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.  Fermi sees light with energies about a billion times what the human eye can see, and the map combines 12 years of Fermi observations.  The colors represent the brightness of the gamma-ray sources, with brighter sources appearing lighter in color.  The prominent stripe across the middle is the central plane of our Milky Way galaxy.  Most of the red and yellow dots scattered above and below the Milky Way\u2019s plane are very distant galaxies, while most of those within the plane are nearby pulsars.  The blue background that fills the image is the diffuse glow of gamma-rays from distant sources that are too dim to be detected individually.

In fact, monstrous clumps of dust and molecular gas collapsing to form stars may well lurk within the dark nebula, a structure that spans almost 40 light-years across this gorgeous telescopic portrait. A cometary globule, the swept-back cloud is shaped by intense ultraviolet radiation from the OB association of very hot stars in NGC 6231, off the upper right corner of the scene. That energetic ultraviolet light also powers the globule&#x27;s bordering reddish glow of hydrogen gas. Hot stars embedded in the dust can be seen as bluish reflection nebulae. This dark tower and associated nebulae are about 5,000 light-years away.

The supernova remnant was discovered as a source of emission at radio wavelengths by astronomers in 1960 and since identified as the result of the death explosion of a massive star. But no radio pulses were detected from the expected pulsar, the rotating neutron star remnant of the massive star&#x27;s collapsed core. Seen about 10,000 years after the initial supernova explosion, the interstellar debris cloud is faint at optical wavelengths. CTA 1&#x27;s visible wavelength emission from still expanding shock fronts is revealed in this deep telescopic image, a frame that spans about 2 degrees across a starfield in the northern constellation of Cepheus. While no pulsar has since been found at radio wavelengths, in 2008 the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope detected pulsed emission from CTA 1, identifying the supernova remnant&#x27;s rotating neutron star. The source has been recognized as the first in a growing class of pulsars that are quiet at radio wavelengths but pulse in high-energy gamma-rays.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2408/CTA1_15_75_Lelu2048.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Supernova Remnant CTA 1&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2408/CTA1_15_75_Lelu1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;full Moon&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-08-24&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;The full Moon and Earth&#x27;s shadow set together in this island skyscape. The alluring scene was captured Tuesday morning, August 20, from Fiji, South Pacific Ocean, planet Earth. For early morning risers shadowset in the western sky is a daily apparition. Still, the grey-blue shadow is often overlooked in favor of a brighter eastern horizon. Extending through the dense atmosphere, Earth&#x27;s setting shadow is bounded above by a pinkish glow or anti-twilight arch. Known as the Belt of Venus, the arch&#x27;s lovely color is due to backscattering of reddened light from the opposite horizon&#x27;s rising Sun. Of course, the setting Moon&#x27;s light is reddened by the long sight-line through the atmosphere. But on that date the full Moon could be called a seasonal Blue Moon, the third full Moon in a season with four full Moons. And even though the full Moon is always impressive near the horizon, August&#x27;s full Moon is considered by some the first of four consecutive full Supermoons in 2024.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2408/FijiMoonsetWangJin.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;South Pacific Shadowset&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2408/FijiMoonsetWangJin1060.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-08-25&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Do underground oceans vent through canyons on Saturn&#x27;s moon Enceladus?  Long features dubbed tiger stripes are known to be spewing ice from the moon&#x27;s icy interior into space, creating a cloud of fine ice particles over the moon&#x27;s South Pole and creating Saturn&#x27;s mysterious E-ring.  Evidence for this has come from the robot Cassini spacecraft that orbited Saturn from 2004 to 2017.  Pictured here, a high resolution image of Enceladus is shown from a close flyby.  The unusual surface features dubbed tiger stripes are visible in false-color blue.  Why Enceladus is active remains a mystery, as the neighboring moon Mimas, approximately the same size, appears quite dead. An analysis of ejected ice grains has yielded evidence that complex organic molecules exist inside Enceladus. These large carbon-rich molecules bolster -- but do not prove -- that oceans under Enceladus&#x27; surface could contain life.

One of the more common questions during a meteor shower occurs because the time it takes for a meteor to flash is similar to the time it takes for a head to turn.  Possibly, though, the glory of seeing bright meteors shoot across the sky -- while knowing that they were once small pebbles on another world -- might make it all worthwhile, even if your observing partner(s) can&#x27;t always share in your experience. The featured video is composed of short clips taken in Inner Mongolia, China during the 2023 Perseid Meteor Shower. Several bright meteors were captured while live-reaction audio was being recorded -- just as the meteors flashed.  This year&#x27;s 2024 Perseids also produced many beautiful meteors. Another good meteor shower to watch for is the Geminids which peak yearly in mid-December, this year with relatively little competing glow from a nearly new Moon.

Sometimes, it does.  It doesn&#x27;t really go away, though, it just disappears from view when our Moon moves in front.  Such a Saturnian eclipse, more formally called an occultation, was visible along a long swath of Earth -- from Peru, across the Atlantic Ocean, to Italy -- only a few days ago.  The featured color image is a digital fusion of the clearest images captured during the event and rebalanced for color and relative brightness between the relatively dim Saturn and the comparatively bright Moon. Saturn and the comparative bright Moon.  The exposures were all taken from Breda, Catalonia, Spain, just before occultation. Eclipses of Saturn by our Moon will occur each month for the rest of this year. Each time, though, the fleeting event will be visible only to those with clear skies -- and the right location on Earth.

At night -- if the timing is right, and if your telescope is pointed in the right direction.  The complex and beautiful Tulip Nebula blossoms about 8,000 light-years away toward the constellation of Cygnus the Swan.  Ultraviolet radiation from young energetic stars at the edge of the Cygnus OB3 association, including O star HDE 227018, ionizes the atoms and powers the emission from the Tulip Nebula.  Stewart Sharpless cataloged this nearly 70 light-years across reddish glowing cloud of interstellar gas and dust in 1959, as Sh2-101. Also in the featured field of view is the black hole Cygnus X-1, which is also a microquasar because it is one of strongest X-ray sources in planet Earth&#x27;s sky. Blasted by powerful jets from a lurking black hole, its fainter bluish curved shock front is only faintly visible beyond the cosmic Tulip&#x27;s petals, near the right side of the frame.

Prominent near center is 114 kilometer diameter crater Moretus. Moretus is young for a large lunar crater and features terraced inner walls and a 2.1 kilometer high, central peak, similar in appearance to the more northerly young crater Tycho. Mountains visible along the lunar limb at the top can rise about 6 kilometers or so above the surrounding terrain.

Large spiral NGC 7769 is seen face-on to the right. Galaxies of the NGC 7771 group are interacting, making repeated close passages that will ultimately result in galaxy-galaxy mergers on a cosmic timescale. The interactions can be traced by distortions in the shape of the galaxies themselves and faint streams of stars created by their mutual gravitational tides. But a clear view of this galaxy group is difficult to come by as the deep image also reveals extensive clouds of foreground dust sweeping across the field of view.

Although the shape is unusual, the type of structure is not: it is part of an evolving solar prominence.  Looping magnetic fields on the Sun channel the flow of energetic particles, sometimes holding glowing gaseous structures aloft for months.  A prominence glows brightly because it contains particularly hot, dense, or opaque solar plasma. The surprising triangular structure occurred last week. Larger than our Earth, the iconic prominence was imaged by several solar photographers and documented by NASA&#x27;s Solar Dynamic Observatory to form and violently dissipate in about a day.

The picture&#x27;s most famous feature is Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the Solar System, visible on the upper right.  Another large Martian volcano is visible on the right horizon: Pavonis Mons. Several circular impact craters can be seen on the surface of the aptly named red planet. Impressively, this image was timed to capture the dark and doomed Martian moon Phobos, visible just left of center.  The surface feature on the lower left, known as Orcus Patera, is unusual for its large size and oblong shape, and mysterious because the processes that created it still remain unknown.  ESA&#x27;s robotic Mars Express spacecraft was launched in 2003 and, among many notable science discoveries, bolstered evidence that Mars was once home to large bodies of water.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2409/MarsPan_ExpressLuck_2048.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Mars: Moon, Craters, and Volcanos&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2409/MarsPan_ExpressLuck_1080.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nAntoine &amp; Dalia Grelin\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-09-10&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;The dark Horsehead Nebula and the glowing Orion Nebula are contrasting cosmic vistas. Adrift 1,500 light-years away in one of the night sky&#x27;s most recognizable constellations, they appear in opposite corners of the above stunning mosaic. The familiar Horsehead nebula appears as a dark cloud, a small silhouette notched against the long glow of hydrogen -- here shown in gold -- at the lower left. Alnitak is the easternmost star in Orion&#x27;s belt and is seen as the bright star to the left of the Horsehead. Just below Alnitak is the Flame Nebula, with clouds of bright emission and dramatic dark dust lanes. The magnificent emission region, the Orion Nebula (aka M42), lies at the upper right. Immediately to its left is a prominent reflection nebula sometimes called the Running Man. Pervasive tendrils of glowing hydrogen gas are easily traced throughout the region.

A prominent destination for astrophotographers, the Tatras are the highest mountain range in the Carpathians. In the featured image taken in May, one can see the center of our Milky Way galaxy with two of its famous stellar nurseries, the Lagoon and Omega Nebula, just over the top of the Tatras. Stellar nurseries are full of ionized hydrogen, a fundamental component for the formation of Earth-abundant water. As a fundamental ingredient in all known forms of life, water is a crucial element in the Universe. Such water can be seen in the foreground in the form of the Bialka River.

A mere 1,000 light-years distant toward the heroic constellation Perseus, the nearby star cluster lies at the edge of the large Perseus molecular cloud. Part of Webb&#x27;s deep exploration of the region to identify low mass brown dwarf stars and free floating planets, the space telescope&#x27;s combined field of view spans nearly 2 light-years across the dusty cluster&#x27;s turbulent stellar nursery. In fact, NGC 1333 is known to harbor stars less than a million years old, though most are hidden from optical telescopes by the pervasive stardust. The chaotic environment may be similar to one in which our own Sun formed over 4.5 billion years ago.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2409/NGC1333Webb.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Young Star Cluster NGC 1333&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2409/NGC1333Webb1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-09-13&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;This snapshot from the International Space Station was taken on August 11 while orbiting about 430 kilometers above the Indian Ocean, Southern Hemisphere, planet Earth. The spectacular view looks south and east, down toward the planet&#x27;s horizon and through red and green curtains of aurora australis. The auroral glow is caused by emission from excited oxygen atoms in the extremely rarefied upper atmosphere still present at the level of the orbiting outpost. Green emission from atomic oxygen dominates this scene at altitudes of 100 to 250 kilometers, while red emission from atomic oxygen can extend as high as 500 kilometers altitude. Beyond the glow of these southern lights, this view from low Earth orbit reveals the starry sky from a southern hemisphere perspective. Stars in Orion&#x27;s belt and the Orion Nebula are near the Earth&#x27;s limb just left of center. Sirius, alpha star of Canis Major and brightest star in planet Earth&#x27;s night is above center along the right edge of the southern orbital skyscape.

Arranged as pixels in a framed image, the lunar disks were photographed at different times. Their varying hues are ultimately due to reflected sunlight affected by changing atmospheric conditions and the alignment geometry of Moon, Earth, and Sun. Here, the darkest lunar disks are the colors of earthshine. A description of earthshine, in terms of sunlight reflected by Earth&#x27;s oceans illuminating the Moon&#x27;s dark surface, was written over 500 years ago by Leonardo da Vinci.  But stand farther back from your screen or just shift your gaze to the smaller versions of the image. You might also see one of da Vinci&#x27;s most famous works of art.

This common question plays on the ability of humans to see pareidolia -- imagining familiar icons where they don&#x27;t actually exist. The textured surface of Earth&#x27;s full Moon is home to numerous identifications of iconic objects, not only in modern western culture but in world folklore throughout history. Examples, typically dependent on the Moon&#x27;s perceived orientation, include the Woman in the Moon and the Rabbit in the Moon. One facial outline commonly identified as the Man in the Moon starts by imagining the two dark circular areas -- lunar maria -- here just above the Moon&#x27;s center, to be the eyes.  Surprisingly, there actually is a man in this Moon image -- a close look will reveal a real person -- with a telescope -- silhouetted against the Moon. This well-planned image was taken in 2016 in Cadalso de los Vidrios in Madrid, Spain.

No one is sure.  The unusual feature called Vivaldi Crater spans 215 kilometers and was imaged again in great detail by ESA&#x27;s and JAXA&#x27;s robotic BepiColombo spacecraft on a flyby earlier this month. A large circular feature on a rocky planet or moon is usually caused by either an impact by a small asteroid or a comet fragment, or a volcanic eruption. In the case of Vivaldi, it is possible that both occurred -- a heavy strike that caused a smooth internal lava flow.  Double-ringed craters are rare, and the cause of the inner rings remains a topic of research.  The speed-slowing gravity-assisted flyby of Mercury by BepiColombo was in preparation for the spacecraft entering orbit around the Solar System&#x27;s innermost planet in 2026.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2409/MercuryCaloris_BepiColombo_1806.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Mercury&#x27;s Vivaldi Crater from BepiColombo&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2409/MercuryCaloris_BepiColombo_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nRichard McInnis\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-09-17&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Cosmic clouds form fantastic shapes in the central regions of emission nebula IC 1805. The clouds are sculpted by stellar winds and radiation from massive hot stars in the nebula&#x27;s newborn star cluster, Melotte 15. About 1.5 million years young, the cluster stars are scattered in this colorful skyscape, along with dark dust clouds in silhouette against glowing atomic gas. A composite of narrowband and broadband telescopic images, the view spans about 15 light-years and includes emission from ionized hydrogen, sulfur, and oxygen atoms mapped to green, red, and blue hues in the popular Hubble Palette. Wider field images reveal that IC 1805&#x27;s simpler, overall outline suggests its popular name - the Heart Nebula. IC 1805 is located about 7,500 light years away toward the boastful constellation Cassiopeia.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2409/HeartMelotte_McInnis_1513.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Melotte 15 in the Heart Nebula&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2409/HeartMelotte_McInnis_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nNeil Corke; \nText: Natalia Lewandowska \n(SUNY Oswego)\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-09-18&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;New stars are born from the remnants of dead stars. The gaseous remnant of the gravitational collapse and subsequent death of a very massive star in our Milky Way created the G296.5+10.0 supernova remnant, of which the featured Mermaid Nebula is part. Also known as the Betta Fish Nebula, the Mermaid Nebula makes up part of an unusual subclass of supernova remnants that are two-sided and nearly circular. Originally discovered in X-rays, the filamentary nebula is a frequently studied source also in radio and gamma-ray light.  The blue color visible here originates from doubly ionized oxygen (OIII), while the deep red is emitted by hydrogen gas. The nebula&#x27;s mermaid-like shape has proven to be useful for measurements of the interstellar magnetic field.

Seen toward the royal northern constellation of Cepheus, the dusty, dark nebula is part of a Milky Way molecular cloud some 1,200 light-years distant. It is also listed as Barnard 150 (B150), one of 182 dark markings of the sky cataloged in the early 20th century by astronomer E. E. Barnard. Packs of low mass stars are forming within, but their collapsing cores are only visible at long infrared wavelengths. Still, the colorful Milky Way stars of Cepheus add to this stunning galactic skyscape.

On September 17/18 the sunlit lunar nearside passed into shadow, just grazing Earth&#x27;s umbra, the planet&#x27;s dark, central shadow cone, in a partial lunar eclipse. Over the two and a half hours before dawn a camera fixed to a tripod was used to record this series of exposures as the eclipsed Harvest Moon set behind Spi\u0161 Castle in the hazy morning sky over eastern Slovakia. Famed in festival, story, and song, Harvest Moon is just the traditional name of the full moon nearest the autumnal equinox.  According to lore the name is a fitting one. Despite the diminishing daylight hours as the growing season drew to a close, farmers could harvest crops by the light of a full moon shining on from dusk to dawn. This September&#x27;s Harvest Moon was also known to some as a supermoon, a term becoming a traditional name for a full moon near perigee.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2409/2024_09_18_ZM_Spis_50mm-Pano_Postupka_1500px.png&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;A Hazy Harvest Moon&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2409/2024_09_18_ZM_Spis_50mm-Pano_Postupka_1024c.png&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Emili Vilamala&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-09-21&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;The defining astronomical moment of this September&#x27;s equinox is at 12:44 UTC on September 22, when the Sun crosses the celestial equator moving south in its yearly journey through planet Earth&#x27;s sky. That marks the beginning of fall for our fair planet in the northern hemisphere and spring in the southern hemisphere, when day and night are nearly equal around the globe.  Of course, if you celebrate the astronomical change of seasons by watching a sunrise you can also look for crepuscular rays. Outlined by shadows cast by clouds, crepuscular rays can have a dramatic appearance in the twilight sky during any sunrise (or sunset). Due to perspective, the parallel cloud shadows will seem to point back to the rising Sun and a place due east on your horizon on the equinox date. But in this spectacular sunrise skyscape captured in early June, the parallel shadows and crepuscular rays appear to converge toward an eastern horizon&#x27;s more northerly sunrise.  The well-composed photo places the rising Sun just behind the bell tower of a church in the town of Vic, province of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2409/RayosCrepusculares.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Sunrise Shadows in the Sky&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2409/RayosCrepusculares_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nAnthony Artese\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-09-22&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Chicago, in a way, is like a modern Stonehenge.

Therefore, today in Chicago, the Sun will set directly down the long equatorially-aligned grid of streets and buildings, an event dubbed #chicagohenge.  Featured here is a Chicago Henge picture taken during the  equinox in mid-September of 2017 looking along part of Upper Wacker Drive.

Optimistic predictions have Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan\u2013ATLAS) briefly becoming easily visible to the unaided eye -- although the future brightness of comets are notoriously hard to predict, and this comet may even break up in warming sunlight. What is certain is that the comet is now unexpectedly bright and is on track to pass its closest to the Sun (0.39 AU) later this week and closest to the Earth (0.47 AU) early next month.  The featured image was taken in late May as Comet Tsuchinshan\u2013ATLAS, discovered only last year, passed nearly in front of two distant galaxies.  The comet can now be found with binoculars in the early morning sky rising just before the Sun, while over the next few weeks it will brighten as it moves to the early evening sky.

Known for its iconic blue stars, the Pleiades is shown here in infrared light where the surrounding dust outshines the stars. Here, three infrared colors have been mapped into visual colors (R&#x3D;24, G&#x3D;12, B&#x3D;4.6 microns). The base images were taken by NASA&#x27;s orbiting Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) spacecraft. Cataloged as M45 and nicknamed the Seven Sisters, the Pleiades star cluster is by chance situated in a passing dust cloud. The light and winds from the massive Pleiades stars preferentially repel smaller dust particles, causing the dust to become stratified into filaments, as seen. The featured image spans about 20 light years at the distance of the Pleiades, which lies about 450 light years distant toward the constellation of the Bull (Taurus).&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2409/Pleiades_WiseAntonucci_5000.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Seven Dusty Sisters&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2409/Pleiades_WiseAntonucci_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nDaniel Korona\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-09-30&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;The new comet has passed its closest to the Sun and is now moving closer to the Earth. C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan\u2013ATLAS) is currently moving out from inside the orbit of Venus and on track to pass its nearest to the Earth in about two weeks.  Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS, pronounced \&quot;Choo-cheen-shahn At-less,\&quot;, is near naked-eye visibility and easily picked up by long-exposure cameras.  The comet can also now be found by observers in Earth&#x27;s northern hemisphere as well as the south.  The featured image was captured just a few days ago above Zacatecas, Mexico. Because clouds were obscuring much of the pre-dawn sky, the astrophotographer released a drone to take pictures from higher up, several of which were later merged to enhance the comet&#x27;s visibility. Although the future brightness of comets is hard to predict, there is increasing hope that Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS will further brighten as it enters the early evening sky.

A new record was found just recently with the discovery of a 23-million light-year long jet pair from a black hole active billions of years ago.  Dubbed Porphyrion for a mythological Greek giant, the impressive jets were created by a type of black hole that does not usually create long jets -- one that is busy creating radiation from infalling gas. The featured animated video depicts what it might look like to circle around this powerful black hole system.  Porphyrion is shown as a fast stream of energetic particles, and the bright areas are where these particles are impacting surrounding gas. The discovery was made using data from the Keck and Mayall  (DESI) optical observatories as well as LOFAR and the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope.  The existence of these jets demonstrates that black holes can affect not only their home galaxies but far out into the surrounding universe.

If you live in the south, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is quite noticeable, spanning about 10 degrees across the night sky, which is 20 times larger than the full moon towards the southern constellation of the dolphinfish (Dorado). Being only about 160,000 light years away, many details of the LMC&#x27;s structure can be seen, such as its central bar and its single spiral arm. The LMC harbors numerous stellar nurseries where new stars are being born, which appear in pink in the featured image. It is home to the Tarantula Nebula, the currently most active star forming region in the entire Local Group, a small collection of nearby galaxies dominated by the massive Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies. Studies of the LMC and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) by Henrietta Swan Leavitt led to the discovery of the period-luminosity relationship of Cepheid variable stars that are used to measure distances across the nearby universe.

Fondly known as comet A3, this new visitor to the inner Solar System is traveling from the distant Oort cloud. The comet reached perihelion, its closest approach to the Sun, on September 27 and will reach perigee, its closest to our fair planet, on October 12, by then becoming an evening sky apparition. But comet A3 was an early morning riser on September 30 when this image was made. Its bright coma and already long tail share a pre-dawn skyscape from Praia Grande, Santa Catarina in southern Brazil with the waning crescent Moon just peeking above the eastern horizon. While the behaviour of comets is notoriously unpredictable, Tsuchinshan\u2013ATLAS could become a comet visually rivaling C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE). Comet NEOWISE wowed skygazers in the summer of 2020.

This is number 27 on his now famous not-a-comet list. In fact, 21st century astronomers would identify it as a planetary nebula, but it&#x27;s not a planet either, even though it may appear round and planet-like in a small telescope. Messier 27 (M27) is an excellent example of a gaseous emission nebula created as a sun-like star runs out of nuclear fuel in its core. The nebula forms as the star&#x27;s outer layers are expelled into space, with a visible glow generated by atoms excited by the dying star&#x27;s intense but invisible ultraviolet light. Known by the popular name of the Dumbbell Nebula, the beautifully symmetric interstellar gas cloud is over 2.5 light-years across and about 1,200 light-years away in the constellation Vulpecula.

The magnificent tail spread across the sky and was visible for several days to Southern Hemisphere observers just after sunset.  The amazing ion tail showed its greatest extent on long-duration, wide-angle camera exposures.  During some times, just the tail itself was visible just above the horizon for many northern observers as well. Comet C/2006 P1 (McNaught), estimated to have attained a peak brightness of  magnitude -5 (minus five), was caught by the comet&#x27;s discoverer in the featured image just after sunset in January 2007 from Siding Spring Observatory in Australia.

OK, but can you explain why there\u2019s a big dark spot in the center? The spot is the Moon, and the impressive alignment shown, where the Moon lines up inside the Sun, is called an annular solar eclipse. Such an eclipse occurred just last week and was visible from a thin swath mostly in Earth&#x27;s southern hemisphere. The featured image was captured from Patagonia, Chile. When the Moon is significantly closer to the Earth and it aligns with the Sun, a total solar eclipse is then visible from parts of the Earth. Annular eclipses are slightly more common than total eclipses, but as the Moon moves slowly away from the Earth, before a billion more years, the Moon&#x27;s orbit will no longer bring it close enough for a total solar eclipse to be seen from anywhere on Earth.

Shimmering curtains of aurora borealis or northern lights definitely do not make regular appearances here, though. Surprisingly vivid auroral displays were present on that night at very low latitudes around the globe, far from their usual northern and southern high latitude realms. The extensive auroral activity was evidence of a severe geomagnetic storm triggered by the impact of a coronal mass ejection (CME), an immense magnetized cloud of energetic plasma.

With two telephoto frames combined, the image stretches about 26 degrees across the sky from top to bottom, looking west from Gates Pass, Tucson, Arizona. Comet watchers that night could even identify globular star cluster M5 and the faint apparition of periodic comet 13P Olbers near the long the path of Tsuchinshan-ATLAS&#x27;s whitish dust tail above the bright comet&#x27;s coma. Due to perspective as the Earth is crossing the comet&#x27;s orbital plane, Tsuchinshan-ATLAS also has a pronounced antitail. The antitail is composed of dust previously released and fanning out away from the Sun along the comet&#x27;s orbit, visible as a needle-like extension below the bright coma toward the rugged western horizon.

The images were taken with the same camera and lens at the indicated dates and locations from California, planet Earth. At far right on October 12 the visitor from the distant Oort cloud was near its closest approach, some 70 million kilometers (about 4 light-minutes) away. Its bright coma and long dust tail were close on the sky to the setting Sun but still easy to spot against a bright western horizon. Over the following days, the outbound comet steadily climbs above the ecliptic and north into the darker western evening sky, but begins to fade from view. Crossing the Earth&#x27;s orbital plane around October 14, Tsuchinshan-ATLAS exhibits a noticeable antitail extended toward the western horizon. Higher in the evening sky at sunset by October 17 (far left) the comet has faded and reached a distance of around 77 million kilometers from planet Earth. Hopefully you enjoyed some of Tsuchinshan-ATLAS&#x27;s bid to become the best comet of 2024. This comet&#x27;s initial orbital period estimates were a mere 80,000 years, but in fact it may never return to the inner Solar System.

It might look that way on this dark matter map.  The gravity of unseen dark matter is the leading explanation for why galaxies rotate so fast, why galaxies orbit clusters so fast, why gravitational lenses so strongly deflect light, and why visible matter is distributed as it is both in the local universe and on the cosmic microwave background.  The featured image from the American Museum of Natural History&#x27;s Hayden Planetarium Space Show Dark Universe highlights one example of how pervasive dark matter might haunt our universe.  In this frame from a detailed computer simulation, complex filaments of dark matter, shown in black, are strewn about the universe like spider webs, while the relatively rare clumps of familiar baryonic matter are colored orange. These simulations are good statistical matches to astronomical observations.  In what is perhaps a scarier turn of events, dark matter -- although quite strange and in an unknown form -- is no longer thought to be the strangest source of gravity in the universe. That honor now falls to dark energy, a more uniform source of repulsive gravity that seems to now dominate the expansion of the entire universe.

Pictured, C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan\u2013ATLAS) was captured near peak impressiveness last week over the Eastern Sierra Mountains in California, USA.  The comet not only showed a bright tail, but a distinct anti-tail pointing in nearly the opposite direction. The globular star cluster M5 can be seen on the right, far in the distance.  As it approached, it was unclear if this crumbling iceberg would disintegrate completely as it warmed in the bright sunlight. In reality, the comet survived to become brighter than any star in the night (magnitude -4.9), but unfortunately was then so nearly in front of the Sun that it was hard for many casual observers to locate. Whether Comet Tsuchinshan-Atlas becomes known as the Great Comet of 2024 now depends, in part, on how impressive incoming comet C/2024 S1 (ATLAS) becomes over the next two weeks.

This pillar-capturing picture of the Eagle Nebula combines visible light exposures taken with the Hubble Space Telescope with infrared images taken with the James Webb Space Telescope to highlight evaporating gaseous globules (EGGs) emerging from pillars of molecular hydrogen gas and dust.  The giant pillars are light years in length and are so dense that interior gas contracts gravitationally to form stars.  At each pillar&#x27;s end, the intense radiation of bright young stars causes low density material to boil away, leaving stellar nurseries of dense EGGs exposed.

The once sun-like star&#x27;s last few thousand years have produced the Helix Nebula. Also known as NGC 7293, the cosmic Helix is a well studied and nearby example of a Planetary Nebula, typical of this final phase of stellar evolution.  Combining narrow band data from emission lines of hydrogen atoms in red and oxygen atoms in blue-green hues, this deep image shows tantalizing details of the Helix, including its bright inner region about 3 light-years across. The white dot at the Helix&#x27;s center is this Planetary Nebula&#x27;s hot, dying central star. A simple looking nebula at first glance, the Helix is now understood to have a surprisingly complex geometry.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2410/NGC7293_preview.png&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;NGC 7293: The Helix Nebula&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2410/NGC7293_preview1024.png&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Massimo Di Fusco&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-10-25&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Some 13,000 light-years away toward the southern constellation Pavo, the globular star cluster NGC 6752 roams the halo of our Milky Way galaxy. Over 10 billion years old, NGC 6752 follows clusters Omega Centauri, 47 Tucanae, and Messier 22 as the fourth brightest globular in planet Earth&#x27;s night sky. It holds over 100 thousand stars in a sphere about 100 light-years in diameter. Telescopic explorations of NGC 6752 have found that a remarkable fraction of the stars near the cluster&#x27;s core are multiple star systems. They also reveal the presence of blue straggle stars, stars which appear to be too young and massive to exist in a cluster whose stars are all expected to be at least twice as old as the Sun. The blue stragglers are thought to be formed by star mergers and collisions in the dense stellar environment at the cluster&#x27;s core. This sharp color composite also features the cluster&#x27;s ancient red giant stars in yellowish hues.

A telescopic view toward the constellation Cassiopeia, the colorful skyscape features the swept-back, comet-shaped clouds IC 59 (left) and IC 63. About 600 light-years distant, the clouds aren&#x27;t actually ghosts. They are slowly disappearing though, under the influence of energetic radiation from hot, luminous star gamma Cas. Gamma Cas is physically located only 3 to 4 light-years from the nebulae and lies just above the right edge of the frame. Slightly closer to gamma Cas, IC 63 is dominated by red H-alpha light emitted as hydrogen atoms ionized by the hot star&#x27;s ultraviolet radiation recombine with electrons. Farther from the star, IC 59 shows less H-alpha emission but more of the characteristic blue tint of dust reflected star light. The field of view spans over 1 degree or 10 light-years at the estimated distance of the interstellar apparitions.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2410/IC63.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Phantoms in Cassiopeia&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2410/IC63_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nMark Hanson and \nMike Selby;\nText: \nMichelle Thaller \n(NASA&#x27;s \nGSFC)\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-10-27&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;What is the most spook-tacular nebula in the galaxy?   One contender is LDN 43, which bears an astonishing resemblance to a vast cosmic bat flying amongst the stars on a dark Halloween night.  Located about 1400 light years away in the constellation Ophiuchus, this molecular cloud is dense enough to block light not only from background stars, but from wisps of gas lit up by the nearby reflection nebula LBN 7.  Far from being a harbinger of death, this 12-light year-long filament of gas and dust is actually a stellar nursery.  Glowing with eerie light, the bat is lit up from inside by dense gaseous knots that have just formed young stars.    Your Sky Surprise: What picture did APOD feature on your birthday?

In this case the river created a Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement (STEVE) that glowed bright red, white, and pink. Details of how STEVEs work remain a topic of research, but recent evidence holds that their glow results from a fast-moving river of hot ions flowing over a hundred kilometers up in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere: the ionosphere. The more expansive dull red glow might be related to the flowing STEVE, but alternatively might be a Stable Auroral Red (SAR) arc, a more general heat-related glow. The featured picture, taken earlier this month in C\u00f4te d&#x27;Opale, France, is a wide-angle digital composite made as the STEVE arc formed nearly overhead.  Although the apparition lasted only a few minutes, this was long enough for the quick-thinking astrophotographer to get in the picture -- can you find him?&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2410/SteveFrance_leroux_2160.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;STEVE: A Glowing River over France&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2410/SteveFrance_leroux_1080.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-10-29&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;The stars are destroying the pillars. More specifically, some of the newly formed stars in the image center are emitting light so energetic that is evaporating the gas and dust in the surrounding pillars. Simultaneously, the pillars themselves are still trying to form new stars. The whole setting is the star cluster NGC 602, and this new vista was taken by the Webb Space Telescope in multiple infrared colors. In comparison, a roll-over image shows the same star cluster in visible light, taken previously by the Hubble Space Telescope. NGC 602 is located near the perimeter of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a small satellite galaxy of our Milky Way galaxy.  At the estimated distance of the SMC, the featured picture spans about 200 light-years.

Blown by the wind from a star, this tantalizing, head-like apparition is cataloged as NGC 7635, but known simply as the Bubble Nebula. The featured striking view utilizes a long exposure to reveal the intricate details of this cosmic bubble and its environment. Although it looks delicate, the 10 light-year diameter bubble offers evidence of violent processes at work. Seen here above and right of the Bubble&#x27;s center, a bright hot star is embedded in the nebula&#x27;s reflecting dust. A fierce stellar wind and intense radiation from the star, which likely has a mass 10 to 20 times that of the Sun, has blasted out the structure of glowing gas against denser material in a surrounding molecular cloud. The intriguing Bubble Nebula lies a mere 11,000 light-years away toward the boastful constellation Cassiopeia.   Your Sky Surprise: What picture did APOD feature on your birthday?

In fact, this entrancing telescopic portrait gives the impression that a witch has fixed her gaze on Orion&#x27;s bright supergiant star Rigel. More formally known as IC 2118, the Witch Head Nebula spans about 50 light-years and is composed of interstellar dust grains reflecting Rigel&#x27;s starlight. The color of the Witch Head Nebula is caused not only by Rigel&#x27;s intense blue light, but because the dust grains scatter blue light more efficiently than red. The same physical process causes Earth&#x27;s daytime sky to appear blue, although the scatterers in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere are molecules of nitrogen and oxygen.

We see the disk of the nearby island universe tilted towards our line of sight in this remarkably deep and detailed galaxy portrait, a telescopic image that spans an area about the angular size of a full moon. In it, the giant galaxy&#x27;s elongated yellowish core is dominated by the light from old, cool stars.

Telescopic views of the outer gas giant planet and its beautiful rings often make it a star at star parties. But this stunning view of Saturn&#x27;s rings and night side just isn&#x27;t possible from telescopes in the vicinity of planet Earth. Peering out from the inner Solar System they can only bring Saturn&#x27;s day side into view. In fact, this image of Saturn&#x27;s slender sunlit crescent with night&#x27;s shadow cast across its broad and complex ring system was captured by the Cassini spacecraft. A robot spacecraft from planet Earth, Cassini called Saturn orbit home for 13 years before it was directed to dive into the atmosphere of the gas giant on September 15, 2017. This magnificent mosaic is composed of frames recorded by Cassini&#x27;s wide-angle camera only two days before its grand final plunge.

No one is sure.  During one pass of NASA&#x27;s Juno over  Jupiter, the robotic spacecraft imaged an usually dark cloud feature informally dubbed the Abyss. Surrounding cloud patterns show the Abyss to be at the center of a vortex. Since dark features on Jupiter&#x27;s atmosphere tend to run deeper than light features, the Abyss may really be the deep hole that it appears -- but without more evidence that remains conjecture.  The Abyss is surrounded by a complex of meandering clouds and other swirling storm systems, some of which are topped by light colored, high-altitude clouds.

The image captures Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan\u2013ATLAS) with impressively long dust and ion tails pointing up and away from the Sun, while the strong anti-tail -- composed of more massive dust particles -- trails the comet and points down and (nearly) toward the recently-set Sun. In the foreground is village of Tai di Cadore, Italy, with the tremendous Dolomite Mountains in the background.  Another comet, C/2024 S1 (ATLAS), once a candidate to rival Comet Tsuchinshan-Atlas in brightness, broke up last week during its close approach to our Sun.

Some 100 million light-years distant within the boundaries of the constellation Pisces, Arp 227 consists of the two galaxies prominent above and left of center, the shell galaxy NGC 474 and its blue, spiral-armed neighbor NGC 470. The readily apparent shells and star streams of NGC 474 are likely tidal features originating from the accretion of another smaller galaxy during close gravitational encounters that began over a billion years ago. The large galaxy on the bottom righthand side of the deep image, NGC 467, appears to be surrounded by faint shells and streams too, evidence of another merging galaxy system. Intriguing background galaxies are scattered around the field that also includes spiky foreground stars. Of course, those stars lie well within our own Milky Way Galaxy. The telescopic field of view spans 25 arc minutes or just under 1/2 degree on the sky.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2411/NGC474_S1_Crop.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Shell Galaxies in Pisces&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2411/NGC474_S1_Crop1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Francesco Radici&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-11-08&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Drifting near the plane of our Milky Way galaxy these dusty molecular clouds seem to extend a helping hand on a cosmic scale.

This dramatic view of Neptune&#x27;s night just isn&#x27;t possible for telescopes in the vicinity of planet Earth though. Peering out from the inner Solar System they can only bring Neptune&#x27;s day side into view.  In fact this night side image with Neptune&#x27;s slender crescent next to the crescent of its large moon Triton was captured by Voyager 2.

Named Valles Marineris, the grand valley extends over 3,000 kilometers long, spans as much as 600 kilometers across, and delves as much as 8 kilometers deep.  By comparison, the Earth&#x27;s Grand Canyon in Arizona, USA is 800 kilometers long, 30 kilometers across, and 1.8 kilometers deep.  The origin of the Valles Marineris remains unknown, although a leading hypothesis holds that it started as a crack billions of years ago as the planet cooled.  Several geologic processes have been identified in the canyon.

Some images of the bright comet during mid-October not only caught its impressively long tail and its thin anti-tail, but a rather unexpected feature: a dark streak in the long tail. The reason for the dark streak is currently unclear and a topic of some debate.  Possible reasons include a plume of dark dust, different parts of the bright tail being unusually superposed, and a shadow of a dense part of the coma on smaller dust particles. The streak is visible in the featured image taken on October 14 from Texas, USA. To help future analyses, if you have taken a good image of the comet that clearly shows this dark streak, please send it in to APOD. Comet Tsuchinshan\u2013ATLAS has now faded considerably and is returning to the outer Solar System.

Looking like an emerging space cocoon, the Crescent Nebula, visible in the center of the featured image, was created by the brightest star in its center.  A leading progenitor hypothesis has the Crescent Nebula beginning to form about 250,000 years ago.  At that time, the massive central star had evolved to become a Wolf-Rayet star (WR 136), shedding its outer envelope in a strong stellar wind, ejecting the equivalent of our Sun&#x27;s mass every 10,000 years.  This wind impacted surrounding gas left over from a previous phase, compacting it into a series of complex shells, and lighting it up.  The Crescent Nebula, also known as NGC 6888, lies about 4,700 light-years away in the constellation of Cygnus.  Star WR 136 will probably undergo a supernova explosion sometime in the next million years.

This sharp image from the James Webb Space Telescope&#x27;s Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) reveals stunning details of this magnificent spiral in infrared light. Webb&#x27;s field of view stretches about 60,000 light-years across NGC 1365, exploring the galaxy&#x27;s core and bright newborn star clusters. The intricate network of dusty filaments and bubbles is created by young stars along spiral arms winding from the galaxy&#x27;s central bar. Astronomers suspect the gravity field of NGC 1365&#x27;s bar plays a crucial role in the galaxy&#x27;s evolution, funneling gas and dust into a star-forming maelstrom and ultimately feeding material into the active galaxy&#x27;s central, supermassive black hole.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2411/JWSTMIRI_ngc1365.png&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Barred Spiral Galaxy NGC 1365 from Webb&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2411/JWSTMIRI_ngc1365_1024.png&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Ashraf Abu Sara&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-11-14&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;A great nebulous region near bright star omicron Persei offers this study in cosmic contrasts.

Immediately below it lies the intriguing young star cluster IC 348 recently explored at infrared wavelengths by the James Webb Space Telescope. In silhouette against the diffuse reddish glow of hydrogen gas, dark and obscuring interstellar dust cloud Barnard 3 is at upper right.

This illuminated cavity, known as LDN 1471, was created by a newly forming star, seen as the bright source at the peak of the parabola.  This protostar is experiencing a stellar outflow which is then interacting with the surrounding material in the Perseus Molecular Cloud, causing it to brighten.  We see only one side of the cavity -- the other side is hidden by dark dust.  The parabolic shape is caused by the widening of the stellar-wind blown cavity over time. Two additional structures can also be seen either side of the protostar; these are known as Herbig-Haro objects, again caused by the interaction of the outflow with the surrounding material.  What causes the striations on the cavity walls, though, remains unknown.

The tools the stars use to carve their detailed works are high energy light and fast stellar winds.  The heat they generate evaporates the dark molecular dust as well as causing ambient hydrogen gas to disperse and glow.   Pictured here, a new open cluster of stars designated IC 1590 is nearing completion around the intricate interstellar dust structures in the emission nebula  NGC 281, dubbed the Pac-man Nebula because of its overall shape.  The dust cloud just above center is classified as a  Bok Globule as it may gravitationally collapse and form a star -- or stars.

While it may seem that these long and thin clouds are pointing toward the top of a hill, and that maybe a world-famous observatory is located there, only part of that is true. In terms of clouds, the formation is a chance superposition of impressively periodic undulating air currents in Earth&#x27;s lower atmosphere. Undulatus, a type of Asperitas cloud, form at the peaks where the air is cool enough to cause the condensation of opaque water droplets.  The wide-angle nature of the panorama creates the illusion that the clouds converge over the hill.  In terms of land, there really is a world-famous observatory at the top of that peak: the Carnegie Science&#x27;s Las Campanas Observatory in the Atacama Desert of Chile.  The two telescope domes visible are the 6.5-meter Magellan Telescopes.

On the sixth day of the Artemis I mission, their home world is setting behind the Moon&#x27;s bright edge as viewed by an external camera on the outbound Orion spacecraft. Orion was headed for a powered flyby that took it to within 130 kilometers of the lunar surface. Velocity gained in the flyby maneuver was used to reach a distant retrograde orbit around the Moon. That orbit is considered distant because it&#x27;s another 92,000 kilometers beyond the Moon, and retrograde because the spacecraft orbited in the opposite direction of the Moon&#x27;s orbit around planet Earth. Orion entered its distant retrograde orbit on November 25. Swinging around the Moon, Orion reached a maximum distance (just over 400,000 kilometers) from Earth on November 28, exceeding a record set by Apollo 13 for most distant spacecraft designed for human space exploration.

The red glow originates from hydrogen gas predominantly behind the nebula, ionized by the nearby bright star Sigma Orionis.  The darkness of the Horsehead is caused mostly by thick dust, although the lower part of the Horsehead&#x27;s neck casts a shadow to the left.  Streams of gas leaving the nebula are funneled by a strong magnetic field.  Bright spots in the Horsehead Nebula&#x27;s base are young stars just in the process of forming.

The streak on the upper right is Comet Tsuchinshan-Atlas showing an impressive dust tail. The comet is a large and dirty iceberg that entered the inner Solar System and is shedding gas and dust as it is warmed by the Sun&#x27;s light. The streak on the lower left is a meteor showing an impressive evaporation trail.  The meteor is a small and cold rock that entered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and is shedding gas and dust as it is warmed by molecular collisions.  The meteor was likely once part of a comet or asteroid -- perhaps later composing part of its tail.  The meteor was gone in a flash and was only caught by coincidence during a series of exposures documenting the comet&#x27;s long tail.

Also known as M31, the spiral galaxy is a mere 2.5 million light-years away. NGC 206 is found at the center of this sharp and detailed close-up of the southwestern extent of Andromeda&#x27;s disk. The bright, blue stars of NGC 206 indicate its youth. In fact, its youngest massive stars are less than 10 million years old. Much larger than the open or galactic clusters of young stars in the disk of our Milky Way galaxy, NGC 206 spans about 4,000 light-years. That&#x27;s comparable in size to the giant stellar nurseries NGC 604 in nearby spiral M33 and the Tarantula Nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2411/NGC206_APOD.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;NGC 206 and the Star Clouds of Andromeda&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2411/NGC206_APOD1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Steve Crouch&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-11-29&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Messier 4 can be found west of bright red-giant star Antares, alpha star of the constellation Scorpius. M4 itself is only just visible from dark sky locations, even though the globular cluster of 100,000 stars or so is a mere 5,500 light-years away. Still, its proximity to prying telescopic eyes makes it a prime target for astronomical explorations. Recent studies have included Hubble observations of M4&#x27;s pulsating cepheid variable stars, cooling white dwarf stars, and ancient, pulsar orbiting exoplanet PSR B1620-26 b. This sharp image was captured with a small telescope on planet Earth. At M4&#x27;s estimated distance it spans about 50 light-years across the core of the globular star cluster.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2411/m4_STXL16200_RC14_LRGB.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Messier 4&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2411/m4_STXL16200_RC14_LRGB1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Camille Niel&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-11-30&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Winter and summer appear to come on a single night to this stunning little planet.

More precisely, if the entire sky were smeared out, what color would the final mix be?  This whimsical question came up when trying to determine what stars are commonplace in nearby galaxies. The answer, depicted here, is a conditionally perceived shade of beige. In computer parlance: #FFF8E7.  To determine this, astronomers computationally averaged the light emitted by one of the larger samples of galaxies analyzed: the 200,000 galaxies of the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey.  The resulting cosmic spectrum has some emission in all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, but a single perceived composite color.  This color has become much less blue over the past 10 billion years, indicating that redder stars are becoming more prevalent.  In a contest to better name the color, notable entries included skyvory, univeige, and the winner: cosmic latte.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2412/CosmicLatte_jhu_960.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Cosmic Latte: The Average Color of the Universe&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2412/CosmicLatte_jhu_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nDaniel Stern\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-12-02&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;This galaxy is unusual for how many stars it seems that you can see. Stars are so abundantly evident in this deep exposure of the spiral galaxy NGC 300 because so many of these stars are bright blue and grouped into resolvable bright star clusters.  Additionally, NGC 300 is so clear because it is one of the closest spiral galaxies to Earth, as light takes only about 6 million years to get here.  Of course, galaxies are composed of many more faint stars than bright, and even more of a galaxy&#x27;s mass is attributed to unseen dark matter.  NGC 300 spans nearly the same amount of sky as the full moon and is visible with a small telescope toward the southern constellation of the Sculptor. The featured image was captured in October from Rio Hurtado, Chile and is a composite of over 20 hours of exposure.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2412/Ngc300_Stern_7032.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;NGC 300: A Galaxy of Stars&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2412/Ngc300_Stern_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-12-03&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;If you could stand on Mars -- what might you see?  You might look out over a vast orange landscape covered with rocks under a dusty orange sky, with a blue-tinted Sun over the horizon, and odd-shaped water clouds hovering high overhead. This was just the view captured last March by NASA&#x27;s rolling explorer,  Perseverance. The orange coloring is caused by rusted iron in the Martian dirt, some of which is small enough to be swept up by winds into the atmosphere. The blue tint near the rising Sun is caused by blue light being preferentially scattered out from the Sun by the floating dust. The light-colored clouds on the right are likely composed of water-ice and appear high in the Martian atmosphere.  The shapes of some of these clouds are unusual for Earth and remain a topic of research.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2412/MarsClouds_Perseverance_2048.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Ice Clouds over a Red Planet&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2412/MarsClouds_Perseverance_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nNick Wright\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-12-04&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Does the Sun return to the same spot on the sky every day?\u00a0 No.\u00a0 A more visual answer is an analemma, a composite of sky images taken at the same time and from the same place over a year.\u00a0 At completion, you can see that the Sun makes a figure 8 on the sky.  The featured unusual analemma does not, however, picture the Sun directly: it was created by looking in the opposite direction. All that was required was noting where the shadow of an edge of a house was in the driveway every clear day at the same time.  Starting in March in Falcon, Colorado, USA, the photographer methodically marked the shadow&#x27;s 1 pm location. In one frame you can even see the photographer himself.

Climbing high in midnight skies the giant planet was a mere 33.4 light-minutes from Singapore. That&#x27;s about 4 astronomical units away. Jupiter&#x27;s planet girdling dark belts and light zones are visible in remarkable detail, along with the giant world&#x27;s whitish oval vortices. Its signature Great Red Spot is prominent in the south. Jupiter rotates rapidly on its axis once every 10 hours. So, based on video frames taken only 15 minutes apart, these images form a stereo pair. Look at the center of the pair and cross your eyes until the separate images come together to see the 3D effect. Of course Jupiter is now not far from its 2024 opposition.

To help answer this question, the Hubble Space Telescope and the Cassini spacecraft monitored Saturn&#x27;s North Pole simultaneously during Cassini&#x27;s final orbits around the gas giant in September 2017.  During this time, Saturn&#x27;s tilt caused its North Pole to be clearly visible from Earth. The featured image is a composite of ultraviolet images of auroras and optical images of Saturn&#x27;s clouds and rings, all taken by Hubble.  Like on Earth, Saturn&#x27;s northern auroras can make total or partial rings around the pole. Unlike on Earth, however, Saturn&#x27;s auroras are frequently spirals -- and more likely to peak in brightness just before midnight and dawn.  In contrast to Jupiter&#x27;s auroras, Saturn&#x27;s auroras appear better related to connecting Saturn&#x27;s internal magnetic field to the nearby, variable, solar wind.  Saturn&#x27;s southern auroras were similarly imaged back in 2004 when the planet&#x27;s South Pole was clearly visible to Earth.    Your Sky Surprise: What picture did APOD feature on your birthday?

Even if you have, you probably have never seen it as large and clear as this. Perhaps the most famous star cluster on the sky, the bright stars of the Pleiades can be seen with the unaided eye even from the depths of a light-polluted city.  With a long exposure from a dark location, though, the dust cloud surrounding the Pleiades star cluster becomes very evident. The featured 23-hour exposure, taken from Fagagna, Italy  covers a sky area several times the size of the full moon.  Also known as the Seven Sisters and M45, the Pleiades lies about 400 light years away toward the constellation of the Bull (Taurus).  A common legend with a modern twist is that one of the brighter stars faded since the cluster was named, leaving only six of the sister stars visible to the unaided eye. The actual number of Pleiades stars visible, however, may be more or less than seven, depending on the darkness of the surrounding sky and the clarity of the observer&#x27;s eyesight.

The Great Meteor Storm of 1833 was perhaps the most impressive meteor event in recent history.  Best visible over eastern North America during the pre-dawn hours of November 13, many people -- including a young Abraham Lincoln -- were woken up to see the sky erupt in streaks and flashes. Hundreds of thousands of meteors blazed across the sky, seemingly pouring out of the constellation of the Lion (Leo).  The featured image is a digitization of a wood engraving which itself was based on a painting from a first-person account. We know today that the Great Meteor Storm of 1833 was caused by the Earth moving through a dense part of the dust trail expelled from Comet Tempel-Tuttle. The Earth moves through this dust stream every November during the Leonid meteor shower. Later this week you might get a slight taste of the intensity of that 1833 meteor storm by witnessing the annual Geminid meteor shower.

That would be Centaurus A, cataloged as NGC 5128, which is only 12 million light-years distant. Forged in a collision of two otherwise normal galaxies, Centaurus A shows several distinctive features including a dark dust lane across its center, outer shells of stars and gas, and jets of particles shooting out from a supermassive black hole at its center.  The featured image captures all of these in a composite series of visible light images totaling over 310 hours captured over the past 10 years with a homebuilt telescope operating in Auckland, New Zealand. The brightness of Cen A&#x27;s center from low-energy radio waves to high-energy gamma rays underlies its designation as an active galaxy.

Even though most meteor shower parents are comets, 3200 Phaethon is a known and closely tracked near-Earth asteroid with a 1.4 year orbital period. Rocky and sun-baked, its perihelion or closest approach to the Sun is well within the orbit of innermost planet Mercury. In this telescopic field of view, the asteroid&#x27;s rapid motion against faint background stars of the heroic constellation Perseus left a short trail during the two minute total exposure time. The (faint) parallel streaks of its meteoric children flashed much more quickly across the scene. The family portrait was recorded near the Geminid meteor shower&#x27;s very active peak on 2017 December 13. That was just three days before 3200 Phaethon&#x27;s historic close approach to planet Earth. This year, the night of December 13 should again see the peak of the Geminid meteor shower, but faint meteors will be washed out by the bright light of the nearly full moon.

Its spiral arms and dust lanes sweep in front of its smaller companion galaxy, NGC 5195. Some 31 million light-years distant, within the boundaries of the well-trained constellation Canes Venatici, M51 looks faint and fuzzy to the eye in direct telescopic views. But this remarkably deep image shows off stunning details of the galaxy pair&#x27;s striking colors and fainter tidal streams.

Pictured here, over two dozen meteors were caught in successively added exposures taken over several hours early Saturday morning from a snowy forest in Poland. The fleeting streaks were bright enough to be seen over the din of the nearly full Moon on the upper right.

It was discovered on the dark nucleus of Comet Churyumov - Gerasimenko (CG) by Rosetta, a robotic spacecraft launched by ESA, which orbited the comet from 2014 to 2016.  The ragged cliff, as featured here, was imaged by Rosetta early in its mission. Although towering about one kilometer high, the low surface gravity of Comet CG would likely make a jump from the cliffs by a human survivable.  At the foot of the cliffs is relatively smooth terrain dotted with boulders as large as 20 meters across. Data from Rosetta indicates that the ice in Comet CG has a significantly different deuterium fraction -- and hence likely a different origin -- than the water in Earth&#x27;s oceans.  The probe was named after the Rosetta Stone, a rock slab featuring the same text written in three different languages that helped humanity decipher ancient Egyptian writing.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2412/CometCliffs_Rosetta_960.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;A Kilometer High Cliff on Comet Churyumov - Gerasimenko&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2412/CometCliffs_Rosetta_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nJeff Horne &amp; \nDrew Evans\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-12-17&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;What excites the Heart Nebula? First, the large emission nebula on the upper left, catalogued as IC 1805, looks somewhat like a human heart.  The nebula glows brightly in red light emitted by its most prominent element, hydrogen, but this long-exposure image was also blended with light emitted by sulfur (yellow) and oxygen (blue).  In the center of the Heart Nebula are young stars from the open star cluster Melotte 15 that are eroding away several picturesque dust pillars with their atom-exciting energetic light and winds. The Heart Nebula is located about 7,500 light years away toward the constellation of Cassiopeia.  This wide field image shows much more, though, including the Fishhead Nebula just below the Heart, a supernova remnant on the lower left, and three planetary nebulas on the image right.  Taken over 57 nights, this image is so deep, though, that it clearly shows fainter long and complex filaments.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2412/Heart_HorneEvans_4096.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Near to the Heart Nebula&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2412/Heart_HorneEvans_1080.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nMike Selby\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-12-18&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;What kind of strange galaxy is this? This rare structure is known as a polar ring galaxy, and it seems to have two different rings of stars.  In this galaxy, NGC 660, one ring of bright stars, gas, and dark dust appears nearly vertical, while another similar but shorter ring runs diagonally from the upper left.  How polar ring galaxies obtain their striking appearance remains a topic of research, but a leading theory holds that it is usually the result of two galaxies with different central ring planes colliding.  NGC 660 spans about 50,000 light years and is located about 40 million light years away toward the constellation of the Fish (Pisces).  The featured image was captured recently from Observatorio El Sauce in Chile.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2412/NGC660_Selby_1720.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;NGC 660: Polar Ring Galaxy&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2412/NGC660_Selby_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-12-19&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;After the Crab Nebula, this giant star cluster is the second entry in 18th century astronomer Charles Messier&#x27;s famous list of things that are not comets. M2 is one of the largest globular star clusters now known to roam the halo of our Milky Way galaxy. Though Messier originally described it as a nebula without stars, this stunning Hubble image resolves stars across the cluster&#x27;s central 40 light-years. Its population of stars numbers close to 150,000, concentrated within a total diameter of around 175 light-years. About 55,000 light-years distant toward the constellation Aquarius, this ancient denizen of the Milky Way, also known as NGC 7089, is 13 billion years old. An extended stellar debris stream, a signature of past gravitational tidal disruption, was recently found to be associated with Messier 2.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2412/potw1913aa.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Messier 2&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2412/potw1913aM2_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Giorgia Hofer&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-12-20&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;On the night of December 15, the Full Moon was bright. Known to some as the Cold Moon or the Long Night Moon, it was the closest Full Moon to the northern winter solstice and the last Full Moon of 2024. This Full Moon was also at a major lunar standstill. A major lunar standstill is an extreme in the monthly north-south range of moonrise and moonset caused by the precession of the Moon&#x27;s orbit over an 18.6 year cycle. As a result, the full lunar phase was near the Moon&#x27;s northernmost moonrise (and moonset) along the horizon.  December&#x27;s Full Moon is rising in this stacked image, a composite of exposures recording the range of brightness visible to the eye on the northern winter night.

The well-planned sequence is constructed of images recorded near the 21st day of the indicated month from the same location overlooking Cairo, Egypt. But for any location on planet Earth the yearly extreme northern (picture right) and southern limits of the setting Sun mark the solstice days. The word solstice is from Latin for \&quot;Sun\&quot; and \&quot;stand still\&quot;. On the solstice date the seasonal drift of the Sun&#x27;s daily path through the sky appears to pause and reverse direction in its annual celestial journey. Of course the Sun reaches a stand still on today&#x27;s date. The 21 December 2024 solstice at 09:21 UTC is the moment of the Sun&#x27;s southernmost declination, the start of astronomical winter in the north and summer in the south.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2412/SunsetYearOmar.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;A Year in Sunsets&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2412/SunsetYearOmar800.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-12-22&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;The stars are not alone.  In the disk of our Milky Way Galaxy, about 10 percent of visible matter is in the form of gas called the interstellar medium (ISM).  The ISM is not uniform and shows patchiness even near our Sun.  It can be quite difficult to detect the local ISM because it is so tenuous and emits so little light.  This mostly hydrogen gas, however, absorbs some very specific colors that can be detected in the light of the nearest stars.  A working map of the local ISM within 20 light-years, based on ongoing observations and particle detections from the Earth-orbiting Interstellar Boundary Explorer satellite  (IBEX), is shown here.  These observations indicate that our Sun is moving through a Local Interstellar Cloud as this cloud flows outwards from the Scorpius-Centaurus Association star forming region.  Our Sun may exit the Local Cloud, also called the Local Fluff, during the next 10,000 years.  Much remains unknown about the local ISM, including details of its distribution, its origin, and how it affects the Sun and the Earth. Unexpectedly, IBEX spacecraft measurements indicate that the direction from which neutral interstellar particles flow through our Solar System is changing.

Shimmering, the vivid green, blue, and purple auroral colors that formed the tree-like apparition were caused by high atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen reacting to a burst of incoming electrons.  Collisions caused the orbital electrons of atoms and molecules to jump into excited energy states and emit visible light when returning to their normal state. The featured image was captured in Dj\u00fapivogur, Iceland during the last month of 2023. Our Sun is currently in its most energetic phase of its 11-year cycle, with its high number of active regions and sunspots likely to last into next year. Of course, the Sun has been near solar maximum during this entire year, with its outbursts sometimes resulting in spectacular Earthly auroras.

Answer: they all occur in the constellation of the Unicorn (Monoceros).  Considered as a star forming region and cataloged as NGC 2264, the complex jumble of cosmic gas and dust is about 2,700 light-years distant and mixes reddish emission nebulae excited by energetic light from newborn stars with dark interstellar dust clouds. The featured image spans an angle larger than a full moon, covering over 50 light-years at the distance of NGC 2264. Its cast of cosmic characters includes the Fox Fur Nebula, whose convoluted pelt lies just to the left of the image center, bright variable star S Mon visible just to the right of the Fox Fur, and the Cone Nebula near the image top.  With the Cone Nebula at the peak, the shape of the general glow of the region give it the nickname of the Christmas Tree Cluster, where stars are tree ornaments.

Diamond dust. That is an informal term for small ice crystals that form in the air and flitter to the ground. Because these crystals are geometrically shaped, they can together reflect light from the Sun or Moon to your eyes in a systematic way, causing huge halos and unusual arcs to appear. And sometimes, together the result can seem like a giant eye looking right back at you. In the featured image taken in the Ore Mountains of the Czech Republic last week, a bright Moon rising through ice fog-filled air resulted in many of these magnificent sky illusions to be visible simultaneously.  Besides Moon dogs, tangent arcs, halos, and a parselenic circle, light pillars above distant lights are visible on the far left, while Jupiter and Mars can be found just inside the bottom of the 22-degree halo.

Its inner 40,000 light-years are shown in sharp detail in this composite of Hubble Space Telescope image data. The galaxy&#x27;s magnificent spiral arms wind from a yellowish central region dominated by light from old stars, while the spiral arms themselves are traced by dust lanes, young blue stars and reddish star forming regions. The bright compact core of NGC 5643 is also known as a strong emitter of radio waves and X-rays.

Methane.  Lake Baikal, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Russia, is the world&#x27;s largest (by volume), oldest, and deepest lake, containing over 20% of the world&#x27;s fresh water. The lake is also a vast storehouse of methane, a greenhouse gas that, if released, could potentially increase the amount of infrared light absorbed by Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, and so increase the average temperature of the entire planet. Fortunately, the amount of methane currently bubbling out is not climatologically important. It is not clear what would happen, though, were temperatures to significantly increase in the region, or if the water level in Lake Baikal were to drop.

Quite possibly.  The first hint of our Sun&#x27;s future was discovered inadvertently in 1764. At that time, Charles Messier was compiling a list of diffuse objects not to be confused with comets. The 27th object on Messier&#x27;s list, now known as M27 or the Dumbbell Nebula, is a planetary nebula, one of the brightest planetary nebulas on the sky and visible with binoculars toward the constellation of the Fox (Vulpecula). It takes light about 1000 years to reach us from M27, featured here in colors emitted by sulfur (red), hydrogen (green) and oxygen (blue). We now know that in about 6 billion years, our Sun will shed its outer gases into a planetary nebula like M27, while its remaining center will become an X-ray hot white dwarf star.  Understanding the physics and significance of M27 was well beyond 18th century science, though. Even today, many things remain mysterious about planetary nebulas, including how their intricate shapes are created.

No one is sure what happened, but a leading model holds that a relatively normal disk galaxy gravitationally ripped apart a dusty satellite galaxy while its precession distorted the plane of the accreted debris as it rotated.  The cosmic collision is hypothesized to have started about a billion years ago.  NGC 4753 is seen from the side, and possibly would look like a normal spiral galaxy from the top.  The bright orange halo is composed of many older stars that might trace dark matter. The featured Hubble image was recently reprocessed to highlight ultraviolet and red-light emissions.

The Alphasystem is not visible in much of the northern hemisphere. Alpha Centauri A, also known as Rigil Kentaurus, is the brightest star in the constellation of Centaurus and is the fourth brightest star in the night sky.

But only rarely is the alignment at both new moon and full moon phases during a single eclipse season close enough to produce a pair with both total (or a total and an annular) lunar and solar eclipses. More often, partial eclipses are part of any eclipse season. In fact, the last eclipse season of 2024 produced this fortnight-separated eclipse pair: a partial lunar eclipse on 18 September and an annular solar eclipse on 2 October.

At perihelion the Earth was about 147 million kilometers from the Sun. For comparison, at aphelion on last July 3 Earth was at its farthest distance from the Sun, some 152 million kilometers away. But distance from the Sun doesn&#x27;t determine Earth&#x27;s seasons. It&#x27;s only by coincidence that the beginning of southern summer (northern winter) on the December solstice is within 14 days of Earth&#x27;s perihelion date. And it&#x27;s only by coincidence that Earth&#x27;s perihelion date is within 11 days of the historic perihelion of NASA&#x27;s Parker Solar Probe. Launched in 2018, the Parker Solar Probe flew within 6.2 million kilometers of the Sun&#x27;s surface on 2024 December 24, breaking its own record for closest perihelion for a spacecraft from planet Earth.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/20250104PeriSolHaNeg.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Welcome to Perihelion&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/20250104PeriSolHaNeg1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-01-05&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Have you ever seen a rocket launch -- from space?  A close inspection of the featured time-lapse video will reveal a rocket rising to Earth orbit as seen from the International Space Station (ISS).  The Russian Soyuz-FG rocket was launched in November 2018 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, carrying a Progress MS-10 (also 71P) module to bring needed supplies to the ISS.  Highlights in the 90-second video (condensing about 15-minutes) include city lights and clouds visible on the Earth on the lower left, blue and gold bands of atmospheric airglow running diagonally across the center, and distant stars on the upper right that set behind the Earth. A lower stage can be seen falling back to Earth as the robotic supply ship fires its thrusters and begins to close on the ISS, a space laboratory that celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2023.

Until then, spiral galaxies NGC 2207 and IC 2163 will slowly pull each other apart, creating tides of matter, sheets of shocked gas, lanes of dark dust, bursts of star formation, and streams of cast-away stars.  The featured image in scientifically assigned colors is a composite of Hubble exposures in visible light and Webb exposures in infrared light. Astronomers predict that NGC 2207, the larger galaxy on the right, will eventually incorporate IC 2163, the smaller galaxy on the left.  In the most recent encounter that about peaked 40 million years ago, the smaller galaxy is swinging around counter-clockwise and is now slightly behind the larger galaxy.  The space between stars is so vast that when galaxies collide, the stars in them usually do not collide.

The new year meant that the Earth had returned to its usual place in its orbit on January 1, a place a few days before its closest approach to the Sun.  The first of the two red skyglows, on the left, was a red aurora, complete with vertical rays, caused by a blast from the Sun pushing charged particles into Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.  The second red glow, most prominent on the far right, was possibly a SAR arc caused by a river of charged particles flowing across Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.  Although both appear red, the slight color difference is likely due to the aurora being emitted by both oxygen and nitrogen, whereas the higher SAR arc was possibly emitted more purely by atmospheric oxygen.

A huge fireball of hot gas shoots out in all directions.  When this gas slams into the existing interstellar medium, it heats up so much it glows. Two different supernova remnants (SNRs) are visible in the featured image, taken at the Ouka\u00efmeden Observatory in Morocco.  The blue soccer ball-looking nebula toward the upper left is SNR G179.0+02.6, which appears to be the smaller one.  This supernova, about 11,000 light years distant, detonated about 50,000 years ago. Although composed mostly of hydrogen gas, the blue light is emitted by a trace amount of oxygen.  The seemingly larger SNR, dominating the lower right of the frame, is the Spaghetti Nebula, cataloged as Simeis 147 and sh2-240.  This supernova, only about 3,000 light years away, exploded about 40,000 years ago. Comparatively, even though they appear different sizes, both supernova remnants are not only roughly the same age, but about the same size, too.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/Supernovas_Vetter_1653.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Supernova Remnants Big and Small&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/Supernovas_Vetter_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Dave Doctor&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-01-09&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;The colorful, spiky stars are in the foreground of this image taken with a small telescope on planet Earth. They lie well within our own Milky Way Galaxy. But the two eye-catching galaxies in the frame lie far beyond the Milky Way, at a distance of over 300 million light-years. The galaxies&#x27; twisted and distorted appearance is due to mutual gravitational tides as the pair engage in close encounters. Cataloged as Arp 273 (also as UGC 1810), these galaxies do look peculiar, but interacting galaxies are now understood to be common in the universe. Closer to home, the large spiral Andromeda Galaxy is known to be some 2 million light-years away and inexorably approaching the Milky Way.  In fact the far away peculiar galaxies of Arp 273 may offer an analog of the far future encounter of Andromeda and Milky Way. Repeated galaxy encounters on a cosmic timescale ultimately result in a merger into a single galaxy of stars. From our perspective, the bright cores of the Arp 273 galaxies are separated by only a little over 100,000 light-years.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/Image171a.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Peculiar Galaxies of Arp 273&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/Image171a.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Long Xin&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-01-10&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;An unassuming region in the constellation Taurus holds these dark and dusty nebulae.

What remains is one of the largest impact craters on one of Saturn&#x27;s smallest round moons.  Analysis indicates that a slightly larger impact would have destroyed Mimas entirely.  The huge crater, named Herschel after the 1789 discoverer of Mimas, Sir William Herschel, spans about 130 kilometers and is featured here. Mimas&#x27; low mass produces a surface gravity just strong enough to create a spherical body but weak enough to allow such relatively large surface features. Mimas is made of mostly water ice with a smattering of rock - so it is accurately described as a big dirty snowball.

Outside the glow of the Sun, Comet C/2024 G3 (ATLAS) would be one of the more remarkable comet sights of recent years, reflecting about as much sunlight to Earth as Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS did in October, and now rivaling even planet Venus. But the giant snowball is now so close to the Sun that it can only be seen through the light of the early morning dawn or the early evening dusk. Today, Comet ATLAS is at perihelion -- its closest ever to the Sun.  Although the future brightness of comets is notoriously hard to predict, there is hope that Comet ATLAS will survive its close pass near the Sun and remain bright enough to be seen with the unaided eye over the next few days -- and possibly a good camera comet for weeks.

First, Polaris is the nearest bright star toward the north spin axis of the Earth.  Therefore, as the Earth turns, stars appear to revolve around Polaris, but Polaris itself always stays in the same northerly direction -- making it the North Star.  Since no bright star is near the south spin axis of the Earth, there is currently no bright South Star.  Thousands of years ago, Earth&#x27;s spin axis pointed in a slightly different direction so that Vega was the North Star.  Although Polaris is not the brightest star on the sky, it is easily located because it is nearly aligned with two stars in the cup of the Big Dipper. Polaris is near the center of the five-degree wide featured image, a digital composite of hundreds of exposures that brings out faint gas and dust of the Integrated Flux Nebula (IFN) all over the frame. The surface of Cepheid Polaris slowly pulsates, causing the famous star to change its brightness by a few percent over the course of a few days.

Yes, but only in the sense that it moves in front, which happens on rare occasions.  This happened just yesterday, though, as seen from some locations in North America and western Africa.  This occultation was notable not only because the Moon was a fully lit Wolf Moon, but because Mars was near its largest and brightest, moving to opposition -- the closest to the Earth in its orbit -- only tomorrow.  The engulfing, more formally called an occultation, typically lasts about an hour. The featured image was taken from near Chicago, Illinois, USA just as Earth&#x27;s largest satellite was angularly moving away from the much more distant red planet. Our  Moon occasionally moves in front of all of the Solar System&#x27;s planets.  Given the temporary alignment of orbital planes, the next time our Moon eclipses Mars will be a relatively soon February 9.

Prominent spiral arms traced by dark dust lanes and blue star clusters lend this galaxy its popular name, The Southern Pinwheel.  Still, reddish star forming regions that dot this cosmic pinwheel&#x27;s spiral arms have suggested another nickname, the Thousand-Ruby Galaxy. A mere 40,000 light-years across, smaller than the Milky Way, M83 is a member of a group of galaxies that includes active galaxy Centaurus A. In fact, the core of M83 itself is bright at x-ray energies, showing a high concentration of neutron stars and black holes left from an intense burst of star formation. This sharp color image also features spiky foreground Milky Way stars and distant background galaxies. The image data was captured with the Dark Energy Camera and Blanco 4-meter telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/noirlab2429a.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;M83: The Southern Pinwheel&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/noirlab2429a_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-01-17&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Massive stars in our Milky Way Galaxy live spectacular lives.  Collapsing from vast cosmic clouds, their nuclear furnaces ignite and create heavy elements in their cores. After only a few million years for the most massive stars, the enriched material is blasted back into interstellar space where star formation can begin anew. The expanding debris cloud known as Cassiopeia A is an example of this final phase of the stellar life cycle. Light from the supernova explosion that created this remnant would have been first seen in planet Earth&#x27;s sky about 350 years ago, although it took that light 11,000 years to reach us. This sharp NIRCam image from the James Webb Space Telescope shows the still hot filaments and knots in the supernova remnant. The whitish, smoke-like outer shell of the expanding blast wave is about 20 light-years across. A series of light echoes from the massive star&#x27;s cataclysmic explosion are also identified in Webb&#x27;s detailed images of the surrounding interstellar medium.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/CasA_nircam_4096.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Supernova Remnant Cassiopeia A&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/CasA_nircam_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;David Bowman&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-01-18&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;On January 13 a Full Moon and a Full Mars were close, both bright and opposite the Sun in planet Earth&#x27;s sky. In fact Mars was occulted, passing behind the Moon, when viewed from some locations in North America and northwest Africa.  As seen from Richmond, Virginia, USA, this composite image sequence follows the evening lunar occultation before, during, and after the much anticipated celestial spectacle. The telescopic time series is constructed from an exposure made every two minutes while tracking the Moon over the hours encompassing the event. As a result, the Red Planet&#x27;s trajectory seems to follow a gently curved path due to the Moon&#x27;s slightly different rate of apparent motion. The next lunar occultation of bright planet Mars will be on February 9 when the moon is in a waxing gibbous phase. Lunar occultations are only ever visible from a fraction of the Earth&#x27;s surface, though. The February 9 occultation of Mars will be seen from parts of Russia, China, eastern Canada, Greenland and other (mostly northern) locations, but a close conjunction of a bright Moon with Mars will be more widely visible from planet Earth.

The European Space Agency&#x27;s Huygens probe set down on the Solar System&#x27;s cloudiest moon in 2005, and a time-lapse video of its descent images was created. Huygens separated from the robotic Cassini spacecraft soon after it achieved orbit around Saturn in late 2004 and began approaching Titan. For two hours after arriving, Huygens plummeted toward Titan&#x27;s surface, recording at first only the shrouded moon&#x27;s opaque atmosphere. The computerized truck-tire sized probe soon deployed a parachute to slow its descent, pierced the thick clouds, and began transmitting images of a strange surface far below never before seen in visible light. Landing in a dried sea and surviving for 90 minutes, Huygen&#x27;s returned unique images of a strange plain of dark sandy soil strewn with smooth, bright, fist-sized rocks of ice.&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;video&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Titan Touchdown: Huygens Descent Movie&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/msiLWxDayuA?rel&#x3D;0&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-01-20&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Why does Comet ATLAS have such colorful tails? Last week Comet C/2024 G3 (ATLAS) passed its closest to the Sun -- well inside the orbit of Mercury -- and brightened dramatically.  Unfortunately, the comet was then so angularly near the Sun that it was very hard for humans to see. But NASA&#x27;s SOHO spacecraft saw it. Pictured is a SOHO (LASCO C3) image of Comet ATLAS that is a composite of several different color filters. Of the several tails visible, the central white tails are likely made of dust and just reflecting back sunlight. The red, blue, and green tails are likely ion tails with their colors dominated by light emitted by specific gases that were ejected from the comet and energized by the Sun.  Currently, Comet ATLAS is showing long tails in southern skies but fading as it moves out of the inner Solar System.

Above the city, above most clouds, far in the distance: it&#x27;s a comet. Pictured, the impressive tail of Comet C/2024 G3 (ATLAS) was imaged from Bras\u00edlia, Brazil four days ago. Last week the evolving  comet rounded the Sun well inside the orbit of planet Mercury, going so close there was early concern that it might break up -- and recent evidence that it really did.  At one point near perihelion, Comet ATLAS was so bright that sightings were even reported during the day -- over the bright sky near the Sun -- by careful observers.  Over the past few days, Comet ATLAS has developed a long tail that has been partly visible with unaided eyes after sunset, most notably in Earth&#x27;s southern hemisphere.

A visitor from the distant Oort Cloud, the comet reached its perihelion on January 13. On January 19, the bright comet was captured here from ESO Paranal Observatory in the Atacama desert in Chile. Sporting spectacular sweeping dust tails, this comet ATLAS is setting in the southern hemisphere twilight and was clearly visible to the unaided eye. In the foreground is the closed shell of one of the observatory&#x27;s famous auxiliary telescopes. Still wowing southern hemisphere observers, the comet&#x27;s bright coma has become diffuse, its icy nucleus apparently disintegrating following its close approach to the Sun.

Dusty nebulae reflecting light from embedded young stars stand out in the nearly 4 degree wide field of view. With a characteristic bluish color reflection nebula NGC 1333 is prominent near center. Hints of contrasting red emission from Herbig-Haro objects, the jets and shocked glowing gas emanating from recently formed stars, are scattered across the dusty expanse. While many stars are forming in the molecular cloud, most are obscured at visible wavelengths by the pervasive dust. The chaotic environment surrounding NGC 1333 may be similar to one in which our own Sun formed over 4.5 billion years ago. At the estimated distance of the Perseus molecular cloud, this cosmic scene would span about 80 light-years.

C/2024 G3 (ATLAS) has developed several long and intricate tails visible from Earth&#x27;s southern hemisphere over the past two weeks. Many observers reported seeing the impressive comet without any optical aid above the western horizon just after sunset. At least six different tails appear in the featured image captured five days ago from the dark skies above Paranal Observatory in Chile.  One possible cause for the multiple tails is dust and gas being expelled from the comet&#x27;s rotating nucleus. The outward push of the Sun&#x27;s complex solar wind may also play a role. The huge iceberg-like nucleus of Comet ATLAS appears to have broken up near its closest approach to the Sun two weeks ago.  Unfortunately, Comet ATLAS and its tails are expected to fade significantly over the coming weeks.    Your Sky Surprise: What picture did APOD feature on your birthday?

The most famous bunch of stars on the sky is the Pleiades, a bright cluster that can be easily seen with the unaided eye.  The Pleiades lies only about 450 light years away, formed about 100 million years ago, and will likely last about another 250 million years. Our Sun was likely born in a star cluster, but now, being about 4.5 billion years old, its stellar birth companions have long since dispersed. The Pleiades star cluster is pictured over Half Dome, a famous rock structure in Yosemite National Park in California, USA. The featured image is a composite of 28 foreground exposures and 174 images of the stellar background, all taken from the same location and by the same camera on the same night in October 2019. After calculating the timing of a future juxtaposition of the Pleiades and Half Dome, the astrophotographer was unexpectedly rewarded by an electrical blackout, making the background sky unusually dark.

When far from the Sun, a comet&#x27;s size usually refers to its hard nucleus of ice and rock, which typically spans a few kilometers -- smaller than even a small moon. When nearing the Sun, however, this nucleus can eject dust and gas and leave a thin tail that can spread to an enormous length -- even greater than the distance between the Earth and the Sun. Pictured, C/2024 G3 (ATLAS) sports a tail of sunlight-reflecting dust and glowing gas that spans several times the apparent size of a full moon, appearing even larger on long duration camera images than to the unaided eye. The featured image shows impressive Comet ATLAS over trees and a grass field in Sierras de Mahoma, San Jose, Uruguay about a week ago.  After being prominent in the sunset skies of Earth&#x27;s southern hemisphere, Comet G3 ATLAS is now fading as it moves away from the Sun, making its impressive tails increasingly hard to see.

Rich in dust, the rings are likely 3D shells -- but how they were created remains a topic of research.  Where they were created is well known: in a binary star system that lies about 6,000 light years away toward the constellation of the Swan (Cygnus) -- a system dominated by the Wolf-Rayet star WR 140.  Wolf-Rayet stars are massive, bright, and known for their tumultuous winds. They are also known for creating and dispersing heavy elements such as carbon, which is a building block of interstellar dust. The other star in the binary is also bright and massive -- but not as active.  The two great stars joust in an oblong orbit as they approach each other about every eight years. When at closest approach, the X-ray emission from the system increases, as, apparently, does the dust expelled into space -- creating another shell.  The featured infrared image by the Webb Space Telescope resolves greater details and more dust shells than ever before. Images taken over consecutive years show the shells moving outward.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/Wr140Rings_Webb_960_2023.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Dust Shells around WR 140 from Webb&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/Wr140Rings_Webb_960_2023.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Pea Mauro&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-01-30&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Gorgeous spiral galaxy Messier 33 seems to have more than its fair share of glowing hydrogen gas. A prominent member of the Local Group of galaxies, M33 is also known as the Triangulum Galaxy and lies a mere 3 million light-years away.  The galaxy&#x27;s central 60,000 light-years or so are shown in this sharp galaxy portrait. The portrait features M33&#x27;s reddish ionized hydrogen clouds or HII regions. Sprawling along loose spiral arms that wind toward the core, M33&#x27;s giant HII regions are some of the largest known stellar nurseries, sites of the formation of short-lived but very massive stars. Intense ultraviolet radiation from the luminous, massive stars ionizes the surrounding hydrogen gas and ultimately produces the characteristic red glow. In this image, broadband data were combined with narrowband data recorded through a filter that transmits the light of the strongest visible hydrogen and oxygen emission lines.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/M33_2048.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Hydrogen Clouds of M33&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/M33_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Tommy Lease&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-01-31&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;The interstellar cloud of dust and gas captured in this sharp telescopic snapshot is seen to change its appearance noticeably over periods as short as a few weeks. Discovered over 200 years ago and cataloged as NGC 2261, bright star R Monocerotis lies at the tip of the fan-shaped nebula. About one light-year across and 2500 light-years away, NGC 2261 was studied early last century by astronomer Edwin Hubble and the mysterious cosmic cloud is now more famous as Hubble&#x27;s Variable Nebula. So what makes Hubble&#x27;s nebula vary? NGC 2261 is composed of a dusty reflection nebula fanning out from the star R Monocerotis.  The leading variability explanation holds that dense knots of obscuring dust pass close to R Mon and cast moving shadows across the dust clouds in the rest of Hubble&#x27;s Variable Nebula.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/HubblesVariablecopy.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Variable Nebula NGC 2261&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/HubblesVariablecopy1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Vojan H\u00f6fer&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-02-01&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Vivid and lustrous, wafting iridescent waves of color wash across this skyscape from northern Sweden. Known as nacreous clouds or mother-of-pearl clouds, they are rare. But their unforgettable appearance was captured in this snapshot on January 12 with the Sun just below the local horizon. A type of polar stratospheric cloud, they form when unusually cold temperatures in the usually cloudless lower stratosphere form ice crystals. Still sunlit at altitudes of around 15 to 25 kilometers, the clouds diffract the sunlight even when the Sun itself is hidden from direct view.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2502/IMG_0340-Internet-2.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Nacreous Clouds over Sweden&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2502/IMG_0340-Internet-2_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-02-02&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;What&#x27;s happening to Comet G3 ATLAS? After passing near the Sun in mid-January, the head of the comet has become dimmer and dimmer. By late January, Comet C/2024 G3 (ATLAS) had become a headless wonder -- even though it continued to show impressive tails after sunset in the skies of Earth&#x27;s Southern Hemisphere. Pictured are images of Comet G3 ATLAS on successive January nights taken from R\u00edo Hurtado, Chile. Clearly, the comet&#x27;s head is brighter and more centrally condensed on the earlier days (left) than on later days (right).  A key reason is likely that the comet&#x27;s nucleus of ice and rock, at the head&#x27;s center, has fragmented. Comet G3 ATLAS passed well inside the orbit of planet Mercury when at its solar closest, a distance that where heat destroys many comets.  Some of comet G3 ATLAS&#x27; scattering remains will continue to orbit the Sun.

Rare, massive Wolf-Rayet stars are so tumultuous and hot that they are slowly disintegrating right before our telescopes.  Glowing gas globs each typically over 30 times more massive than the Earth are being expelled by violent stellar winds.  Wolf-Rayet star WR 124, visible near the featured image center, is thus creating the surrounding nebula known as M1-67, which spans six light years across. Details of why this star has been slowly blowing itself apart over the past 20,000 years remains a topic of research.  WR 124 lies 15,000 light-years away towards the constellation of the Arrow (Sagitta).  The fate of any given Wolf-Rayet star likely depends on how massive it is, but many are thought to end their lives with spectacular explosions such as supernovas or gamma-ray bursts.

Late in the day, the Sun set as usual toward the west. However, on this day, the more interesting display was 180 degrees around -- toward the east. There, not only was a rainbow visible, but an impressive display of anticrepuscular rays from the rainbow&#x27;s center. In the featured image from Lekeitio in northern Spain, the Sun is behind the camera. The rainbow resulted from sunlight reflecting back from falling rain. Anticrepuscular rays result from sunlight, blocked by some clouds, going all the way around the sky, overhead, and appearing to converge on the opposite horizon -- an optical illusion.  Rainbows by themselves can be exciting to see, and anticrepuscular rays a rare treat, but capturing them both together is even more unusual -- and can look both serene and surreal.

In the featured time-lapse video, the comet is not itself moving very much, but the Earth&#x27;s rotation makes it appear to be setting over a hill. The Comet C/2024 G3 (ATLAS) sequence was captured with an ordinary camera on January 22 from the Araucan\u00eda Region in central Chile. Comet ATLAS has been an impressive site in the evening skies of Earth&#x27;s Southern Hemisphere over the past few weeks, so bright and awe-inspiring that it may eventually become known as the Great Comet of 2025. Unfortunately, Comet G3 ATLAS is not going anywhere anymore because its central nucleus broke up during its close pass to the Sun last month. Some of the comet&#x27;s scattered remains of rocks and ice will continue to orbit the Sun, some in nearly the same outward section of the orbit that the comet&#x27;s nucleus would have taken.&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;video&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Comet G3 ATLAS Setting over a Chilean Hill\n&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/nt5j0NiVesQ&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Lorand Fenyes&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-02-06&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Grand spiral galaxies often seem to get all the glory, flaunting their young, bright, blue star clusters in beautiful, symmetric spiral arms. But small, irregular galaxies form stars too. In fact dwarf galaxy IC 2574 shows clear evidence of intense star forming activity in its telltale reddish regions of glowing hydrogen gas. Just as in spiral galaxies, the turbulent star-forming regions in IC 2574 are churned by stellar winds and supernova explosions spewing material into the galaxy&#x27;s interstellar medium and triggering further star formation. A mere 12 million light-years distant, IC 2574 is part of the M81 group of galaxies, seen toward the northern constellation Ursa Major.

Its remarkable appearance in this recently released Hubble Space Telescope image strongly suggests its nickname \&quot;The Bullseye Galaxy\&quot;. Known as a collisional ring galaxy it has nine rings confirmed by telescopic observations, rippling from its center like waves from a pebble dropped into a pond. Of course, the pebble dropped into the Bullseye galaxy was a galaxy itself. Telescopic observations identify the blue dwarf galaxy at center-left as the likely collider, passing through the giant galaxy&#x27;s center and forming concentric rings in the wake of their gravitational interaction. The Bullseye Galaxy lies some 567 million light-years away toward the constellation Pisces.

NASA&#x27;s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft made a careful approach to the near-Earth asteroid 101955 Bennu in October of 2020 to collect surface samples.  In September 2023, the robotic spaceship returned these samples to Earth.  A recent analysis has shown, surprisingly, that the samples contained 14 out of the 20 known amino acids that are the essential building blocks of life.  The presence of the amino acids re-introduces a big question: Could life have originated in space?  However, the protein building blocks themselves held another surprise -- they contained an even mixture of left-handed and right-handed amino acids -- in contrast to our Earth which only has left-handed ones.  This raises another big question: Why does life on Earth have only left-handed amino acids?

All are these nebulae are interstellar dust clouds. Barnard&#x27;s dark nebulae block the light from background stars. For VdB 31 the dust preferentially reflects bluish starlight from embedded, hot, variable star AB Aurigae. Exploring the environs of AB Aurigae with the Hubble Space Telescope has revealed the several million year young star is itself surrounded by a flattened dusty disk with evidence for the ongoing formation of a planetary system. AB Aurigae is about 470 light-years away.

At the edge of a large molecular cloud in Monoceros some 5,000 light years away, the petals of this cosmic rose are actually a stellar nursery. The lovely, symmetric shape is sculpted by the winds and radiation from its central cluster of hot young, O-type stars. Stars in the energetic cluster, cataloged as NGC 2244, are only a few million years young, while the central cavity in the Rosette Nebula, is about 50 light-years in diameter. The nebula can be seen with a small telescope toward the constellation of Monoceros, the Unicorn.

The two bright spots on either side of Earth&#x27;s Sun are parhelia (singular parhelion), also known as mock suns or sun dogs. The parhelia are caused by hexagonal ice crystals suspended in the hazy atmosphere that reflect and refract sunlight.

NASA&#x27;s robotic spacecraft Juno is continuing on its highly elongated orbits around our Solar System&#x27;s largest planet.  The featured video is from perijove 11 in early 2018, the eleventh time Juno passed near Jupiter since it arrived in mid-2016.  This time-lapse, color-enhanced movie covers about four hours and morphs between 36 JunoCam images. The video begins with Jupiter rising as Juno approaches from the north. As Juno reaches its closest view -- from about 3,500 kilometers over Jupiter&#x27;s cloud tops -- the spacecraft captures the great planet in tremendous detail. Juno passes light zones and dark belts of clouds that circle the planet, as well as numerous swirling circular storms, many of which are larger than hurricanes on Earth.  After the perijove, Jupiter recedes into the distance, then displaying the unusual clouds that appear over Jupiter&#x27;s south.

Last Monday, the photogenic launch plume from a SpaceX rocket launch created quite a spectacle over parts of southern California and Arizona.  Looking at times like a giant space fish, the impressive rocket launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base near Lompoc, California, was so bright because it was backlit by the setting Sun. The Falcon 9 rocket successfully delivered to low Earth orbit 23 Starlink communications satellites.  The plume from the first stage is seen on the right, while the soaring upper stage rocket is seen at the apex of the plume toward the left.

But both are winging their way across this broad celestial landscape, spanning almost 7 degrees across planet Earth&#x27;s night sky toward the constellation of the Big Dog (Canis Major). The expansive Seagull (top center) is itself composed of two major cataloged emission nebulas. Brighter NGC 2327 forms the head with the more diffuse IC 2177 as the wings and body. Impressively, the Seagull&#x27;s wingspan would correspond to about 250 light-years at the nebula&#x27;s estimated distance of 3,800 light-years. At the lower right, the Duck appears much more compact and would span only about 50 light-years given its 15,000 light-year distance estimate. Blown by energetic winds from an extremely massive, hot star near its center, the Duck nebula is cataloged as NGC 2359. Of course, the Duck&#x27;s thick body and winged appendages also lend it the slightly more dramatic popular moniker, Thor&#x27;s Helmet.

New clues have been found in the protoplanetary system Herbig-Haro 30 by the James Webb Space Telescope in concert with Hubble and the Earth-bound ALMA.  The observations show, among other things, that large dust grains are more concentrated into a central disk where they can form planets. The featured image from Webb shows many attributes of the active HH-30 system. Jets of particles are being expelled vertically, shown in red, while a dark dust-rich disk is seen across the center, blocking the light from the star or stars still forming there. Blue-reflecting dust is seen in a parabolic arc above and below the central disk, although why a tail appears on the lower left is currently unknown. Studying how planets form in HH 30 can help astronomers better understand how planets in our own Solar System once formed, including our Earth.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2502/HH30_Webb_960.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;HH 30: A Star System with Planets Now Forming&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2502/HH30_Webb_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-02-20&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;rmous elliptical galaxy Messier 87 is about 50 million light-years away.

M87 reigns as the large central elliptical galaxy in the Virgo galaxy cluster. An energetic jet from the giant galaxy&#x27;s core is seen to stretch outward for about 5,000 light-years in this sharp optical and near-infrared view from the Hubble Space Telescope. In fact, the cosmic blow torch is seen across the electromagnetic spectrum from gamma-rays to radio wavelengths. Its ultimate power source is M87&#x27;s central, supermassive black hole.

With 600 overlapping frames assembled from observations made from July 2010 to December 2022, the full Hubble Andromeda Galaxy mosaic spans almost six full moons across planet Earth&#x27;s sky. A cropped version shown above is nearly two full moons across and partially covers Andromeda&#x27;s core and inner spiral arms. Also known as M31, the Andromeda Galaxy is 2.5 million light-years away. That makes it the closest large spiral galaxy to our own Milky Way. Our perspective on the spiral Milky Way is anchored to the view from the location of the Sun, a star found within the Milky Way&#x27;s galactic disk. But Hubble&#x27;s magnificent Andromeda mosaic offers an expansive view of a large spiral galaxy from the outside looking in.

Easy to spot in telescopic views of the Moon, it stretches top left to bottom right across this lunar closeup. The image was made with exaggerated colors that reflect the mineral composition of the lunar soil. Hyginus crater lies near the center of the narrow lunar surface groove. About 10 kilometers in diameter, the low-walled crater is a volcanic caldera, one of the larger non-impact craters on the lunar surface. Dotted with small pits formed by surface collapse, Hyginus rima itself was likely created by stresses due to internal magma upwelling and collapse along a long surface fault. The intriguing region was a candidate landing site for the canceled Apollo 19 mission.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2502/20250205_rima_hyginus_mirabella_1500px.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Rima Hyginus&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2502/20250205_rima_hyginus_mirabella_1024px.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-02-23&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Saturn looks slightly different in infrared light. Bands of clouds show great structure, including long stretching storms.  Also quite striking in infrared is the unusual hexagonal cloud pattern surrounding Saturn&#x27;s North Pole.  Each side of the dark hexagon spans roughly the width of our Earth. The hexagon&#x27;s existence was not predicted, and its origin and likely stability remain a topics of research.  Saturn&#x27;s famous rings circle the planet and cast shadows below the equator. The featured image was taken by the robotic Cassini spacecraft in 2014 in several infrared colors.  In 2017 September, the Cassini mission was brought to a dramatic conclusion when the spacecraft was  directed to dive into the ringed giant.

No, but light from the lava flow can. One effect is something quite unusual -- a volcanic light pillar. More typically, light pillars are caused by sunlight and so appear as a bright column that extends upward above a rising or setting Sun. Alternatively, other light pillars -- some quite colorful -- have been recorded above street and house lights. This light pillar, though, was illuminated by the red light emitted by the glowing magma of an erupting volcano. The volcano is Italy&#x27;s Mount Etna, and the featured image was captured with a single shot during an early morning in mid-February. Freezing temperatures above the volcano&#x27;s lava flow created ice-crystals either in the air above the volcano or in condensed water vapor expelled by Mount Etna. These ice crystals -- mostly flat toward the ground but fluttering -- then reflected away light from the volcano&#x27;s caldera.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2502/LightPillarVolcano_Calio_1333.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Light Pillar over Erupting Etna&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2502/LightPillarVolcano_Calio_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nXinran Li\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-02-25&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Why are there so many bright blue stars?  Stars are usually born in clusters, and the brightest and most massive of these stars typically glow blue. Less-bright, non-blue stars like our Sun surely also exist in this M41 star cluster but are harder to see. A few bright orange-appearing red giant stars are visible. The red-light filaments are emitted by diffuse hydrogen gas, a color that was specifically filtered and enhanced in this image.  In a hundred million years or so, the bright blue stars will have exploded in supernovas and disappeared, while the slightly different trajectories of the fainter stars will cause this picturesque open cluster to disperse. Similarly, billions of years ago, our own Sun was likely born into a star cluster like M41, but it has long since drifted apart from its sister stars.

It is the gravity of NGC 6505, the nearby (z &#x3D; 0.042) elliptical galaxy that you can easily see, that is magnifying and distorting the image of a distant galaxy into a complete circle. To create a complete Einstein ring there must be perfect alignment of the nearby galaxy&#x27;s center and part of the background galaxy. Analysis of this ring and the multiple images of the background galaxy help to determine the mass and fraction of dark matter in NGC 6505&#x27;s center, as well as uncover previously unseen details in the distorted galaxy.

M35 (also cataloged as NGC 2168) is a mere 2800 light-years distant, with 400 or so stars spread out over a volume about 30 light-years across. Bright blue stars frequently distinguish younger open clusters like M35, whose age is estimated at 150 million years. At lower left, NGC 2158 is about four times more distant than M35 and much more compact, shining with the more yellowish light of a population of stars over 10 times older.

The Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF) was created in 2003-2004 with the Hubble Space Telescope staring for a long time toward near-empty space so that distant, faint galaxies would become visible.  One of the most famous images in astronomy, the HUDF is featured here in a vibrant way -- with sonified distances. Pointing to a galaxy will play a note that indicates its approximate redshift. Because redshifts shift light toward the red end of the spectrum of light, they are depicted here by a shift of tone toward the low end of the spectrum of sound.  The further the galaxy, the greater its cosmological redshift (even if it appears blue), and the lower the tone that will be played. The average galaxy in the HUDF is about 10.6 billion light years away and sounds like an F#.

A key reason is its vivid red color. The color is caused by the deflection of blue light by Earth&#x27;s atmosphere -- the same reason that the daytime sky appears blue.  The Moon also appears unusually distorted.  Its strange structuring is an optical effect arising from layers in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere that refract light differently due to sudden differences in temperature or pressure.  A third reason the Moon looks so unusual is that there is, by chance, an airplane flying in front. The featured picturesque gibbous Moon was captured about two weeks ago above Turin, Italy. Our familiar hovering sky orb was part of an unusual quadruple alignment that included two historic ground structures: the Sacra di San Michele on the near hill and Basilica of Superga just beyond.

Also known as the Seven Sisters and M45, the Pleiades is one of the brightest and most easily visible open clusters on the sky. The Pleiades contains over 3,000 stars, is about 400 light years away, and only 13 light years across. Surrounding the stars is a spectacular blue reflection nebula made of fine dust.  A common legend is that one of the brighter stars faded since the cluster was named. On the left, shining in red, is the California Nebula.  Named for its shape, the California Nebula is much dimmer and hence harder to see than the Pleiades.  Also known as NGC 1499, this mass of red glowing hydrogen gas is about 1,500 light years away. Although about 25 full moons could fit between them, the featured wide angle, deep field image composite has captured them both.  A careful inspection of the deep image will also reveal the star forming region IC 348 and the molecular cloud LBN 777 (the Baby Eagle Nebula).

A popular target for earth-based astronomers, the face-on spiral galaxy is about 30,000 light-years across, with spiral arms sweeping through the outskirts of its broad disk. But this Hubble Space Telescope field of view spans about 7,000 light-years or so across M94&#x27;s central region. The sharp close-up examines the galaxy&#x27;s compact, bright nucleus and prominent inner dust lanes, surrounded by a remarkable bluish ring of young, massive stars. The massive stars in the ring appear to be less than about 10 million years old, indicating the galaxy experienced a corresponding well-defined era of rapid star formation. As a result, while the small, bright nucleus is typical of the Seyfert class of active galaxies, M94 is also known as a starburst galaxy. Because M94 is relatively nearby, astronomers can explore in detail reasons for the galaxy&#x27;s burst of star formation.

It lies just south of Orion in planet Earth&#x27;s skies toward the constellation Lepus, The Hare. Surrounded by Milky Way stars and near the line-of-sight to distant background galaxies its generally simple spherical shape, about 8 light-years in diameter, is revealed in this deep telescopic image. Within the cosmic cloud are beautiful and complex structures though, enhanced by the use of long exposures and narrowband filters that capture emission from hydrogen, sulfur, and oxygen atoms. Otherwise Abell 7 would be much too faint to be appreciated by eye. A planetary nebula represents a very brief final phase in stellar evolution that our own Sun will experience 5 billion years hence, as the nebula&#x27;s central, once sun-like star shrugs off its outer layers. Abell 7 itself is estimated to be 20,000 years old. But its central star, seen here as a fading white dwarf, is some 10 billion years old.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/Abell7_VChander4096.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Planetary Nebula Abell 7&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/Abell7_VChander1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-03-08&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;The plane of our Milky Way galaxy extends beyond the limb of planet Earth in this space age exposure captured by astronaut Don Pettit. His camera, with low light and long duration settings, was pointed out the window of a Dragon crew spacecraft docked with the International Space Station on January 29. The orbital outpost was at an altitude of about 400 kilometers above the Pacific Ocean at the time. Motion blurs the Earth below, while the gorgeous view from low Earth orbit includes the Milky Way&#x27;s prominent satellite galaxies, known as the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, near the upper left in the frame. Fans of southern skies can also spot the Southern Cross. The four brightest stars of the famous southern constellation Crux are near picture center, just beyond the edge of the bright horizon and shining through Earth&#x27;s orange tinted atmospheric glow.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/iss072e574593_DonPetit2048.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Galaxies in Space&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/iss072e574593_DonPetit1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-03-09&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Why are there so many cyclones around the north pole of Jupiter? The topic is still being researched.  NASA&#x27;s robotic Juno mission orbiting Jupiter took data in 2018 that was used to construct this stunning view of the curious cyclones at Jupiter&#x27;s north pole. Measuring the thermal emission from Jovian cloud tops, the infrared observations are not restricted to the hemisphere illuminated by sunlight. They reveal eight cyclonic features that surround a cyclone about 4,000 kilometers in diameter, just offset from the giant planet&#x27;s geographic north pole. Similar data show a cyclone at the Jovian south pole with five circumpolar cyclones. The south pole cyclones are slightly larger than their northern cousins. Oddly, data from the once Saturn-orbiting Cassini mission has shown that Saturn&#x27;s north and south poles each have only a single cyclonic storm system.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/JupiterCyclones_Juno_2362.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Cyclones at Jupiter&#x27;s North Pole&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/JupiterCyclones_Juno_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nToni Fabiani Mendez\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-03-10&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Could Queen Calafia&#x27;s mythical island exist in space? Perhaps not, but by chance the outline of this molecular space cloud echoes the outline of the state of California, USA. Our Sun has its home within the Milky Way&#x27;s Orion Arm, only about 1,000 light-years from the California Nebula. Also known as NGC 1499, the classic emission nebula is around 100 light-years long. On the featured image, the most prominent glow of the California Nebula is the red light characteristic of hydrogen atoms recombining with long lost electrons, stripped away (ionized) by energetic starlight. The star most likely providing the energetic starlight that ionizes much of the nebular gas is the bright, hot, bluish Xi Persei just to the right of the nebula.  A regular target for astrophotographers, the California Nebula can be spotted with a wide-field telescope under a dark sky toward the constellation of Perseus, not far from the Pleiades.

Even our own Milky Way Galaxy is thought to have a modest central bar. Prominently barred spiral galaxy NGC 1672, featured here, was captured in spectacular detail in an image taken by the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope. Visible are dark filamentary dust lanes, young clusters of bright blue stars, red emission nebulas of glowing hydrogen gas, a long bright bar of stars across the center, and a bright active nucleus that likely houses a supermassive black hole.  Light takes about 60 million years to reach us from NGC 1672, which spans about 75,000 light years across. NGC 1672, which appears toward the constellation of the Dolphinfish (Dorado), has been studied to find out how a spiral bar contributes to star formation in a galaxy&#x27;s central regions.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/NGC1672B_Hubble_4000.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;NGC 1672: Barred Spiral Galaxy from Hubble&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/NGC1672B_Hubble_1080.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Bax &amp; Serge Brunier,  \nOCA/C2PU; \nText: \nOgetay Kayali \n(Michigan Tech U.)\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-03-12&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Why does this galaxy look like a curly vegetable?  The Fiddlehead spiral galaxy likely gets its distorted spiral appearance from a gravitational interaction with its close-by elliptical companion NGC 770, seen just below.  Cataloged as NGC 772 and Arp 78, the Fiddlehead spans over 200,000 light years, is a nearby 100 million light years beyond the stars of our Milky Way galaxy, and is visible toward the constellation of the Ram (Aries).  But in the featured image, the Fiddlehead appears to have another companion -- one with a long and fuzzy tail: Comet 43P/Wolf-Harrington.  Though the comet appears to be aimed straight at the massive galaxy, it is actually much closer to us, residing only light minutes away -- well within our Solar System.  The comet will never reach the distant spiral galaxy, nor is it physically related to it.  By a fortunate trick of perspective, though, these two cosmic wonders briefly share the same frame taken late last year from Calern, France.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/NGC772Comet_Bax_4724.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;NGC 772: The Fiddlehead Galaxy&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/NGC772Comet_Bax_1080.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-03-13&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Two protostars are hidden in a single pixel near the center of a striking hourglass-shaped nebula in this near-infrared image from the James Webb Space Telescope. The actively forming star system lies in a dusty molecular cloud cataloged as Lynds 483, some 650 light-years distant toward the constellation Serpens Cauda. Responsible for the stunning bipolar outflows, the collapsing protostars have been blasting out collimated energetic jets of material over tens of thousands of years. Webb&#x27;s high-resolution view shows the violence of star-formation in dramatic detail as twisting shock fronts expand and collide with slower, denser material. The premier close-up of the star-forming region spans less than 1/2 a light-year within dark nebula Lynds 483.

The Full Moon, of course. Even though the Moon might look full for several days, the Moon is truly at its full phase when it is Pi radians (aka 180 degrees) from the Sun in ecliptic longitude. That&#x27;s opposite the Sun in planet Earth&#x27;s sky. Rising as the Sun set on March 9, 2020, only an hour or so after the moment of its full phase, this orange tinted and slightly flattened Moon still looked full. It was photographed opposite the setting Sun from Teide National Park on the Canary Island of Tenerife. Also opposite the setting Sun, seen from near the Teide volcano peak about 3,500 meters above sea level, is the mountain&#x27;s rising triangular shadow extending into Earth&#x27;s dense atmosphere. Below the distant ridge line on the left are the white telescope domes of Teide Observatory. Today, March 14 2025, the moon is Pi radians from the Sun at exactly 06:55 UTC. That&#x27;s about three minutes before the midpoint of the March Full Moon&#x27;s total lunar eclipse.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/MoonriseShadowDLopez_1.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Moon Pi and Mountain Shadow&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/MoonriseShadowDLopez_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Petr Hor\u00e1lek&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-03-15&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;On March 14 the Moon was Full. In an appropriate celebration of Pi day, that put the Moon 3.14 radians (180 degrees) in ecliptic longitude from the Sun in planet Earth&#x27;s sky. As a bonus for fans of Pi and the night sky, on that date the Moon also passed directly through Earth&#x27;s umbral shadow in a total lunar eclipse. In clear skies, the colors of an eclipsed Moon can be vivid. Reflecting the deeply reddened sunlight scattered into Earth&#x27;s shadow, the darkened lunar disk was recorded in this time series composite image from Cerro Tololo Observatory, Chile. The lunar triptych captures the start, middle, and end of the total eclipse phase that lasted about an hour. A faint bluish tint seen just along the brighter lunar limb at the shadow&#x27;s edge is due to sunlight filtered through Earth&#x27;s stratospheric ozone layer.

Typically, it is the Earth&#x27;s Moon that eclipses the Sun.  In 2012, though, the planet Venus took a turn.  Like a solar eclipse by the Moon, the phase of Venus became a continually thinner crescent as Venus became increasingly better aligned with the Sun.  Eventually the alignment became perfect and the phase of Venus dropped to zero.  The dark spot of Venus crossed our parent star.  The situation could technically be labeled a Venusian annular eclipse with an extraordinarily large ring of fire.  Pictured here during the occultation, the Sun was imaged in three colors of ultraviolet light by the Earth-orbiting Solar Dynamics Observatory, with the dark region toward the right corresponding to a coronal hole. Hours later, as Venus continued in its orbit, a slight crescent phase appeared again.  The next Venusian transit across the Sun will occur in 2117.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/SunVenusUv3_SdoDove_960.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Venus and the Triply Ultraviolet Sun&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/SunVenusUv3_SdoDove_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nBrian Hopkins \n(East Coast Astronomer)\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-03-17&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Thor not only has his own day (Thursday), but a helmet in the heavens.  Popularly called Thor&#x27;s Helmet, NGC 2359 is a hat-shaped cosmic cloud with wing-like appendages. Heroically sized even for a Norse god, Thor&#x27;s Helmet is about 30 light-years across. In fact, the cosmic head-covering is more like an interstellar bubble, blown by a fast wind from the bright, massive star near the bubble&#x27;s center. Known as a Wolf-Rayet star, the central star is an extremely hot giant thought to be in a brief, pre-supernova stage of evolution. NGC 2359 is located about 15,000 light-years away toward the constellation of the Great Overdog. This sharp image is a mixed cocktail of data from  narrowband filters, capturing not only natural looking stars but details of the nebula&#x27;s filamentary structures. The star in the center of Thor&#x27;s Helmet is expected to explode in a spectacular supernova sometime within the next few thousand years.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/ThorHelmet_Hopkins_3888.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Thor&#x27;s Helmet&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/ThorHelmet_Hopkins_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nTimothy Martin\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-03-18&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;There is no sea on Earth large enough to contain the Shark nebula. This predator apparition poses us no danger as it is composed only of interstellar gas and dust. Dark dust like that featured here is somewhat like cigarette smoke and created in the cool atmospheres of giant stars. After expelling gas and gravitationally recondensing, massive stars may carve intricate structures into their birth cloud using their high energy light and fast stellar winds as sculpting tools.  The heat they generate evaporates the murky molecular cloud as well as causing ambient hydrogen gas to disperse and glow red.  During disintegration, we humans can enjoy imagining these great clouds as common icons, like we do for water clouds on Earth. Including smaller dust nebulae such as Van den Bergh 149 &amp; 150, the Shark nebula, sometimes cataloged as LDN 1235,  spans about 15 light years and lies about 650 light years away toward the constellation of the King of Aethiopia (Cepheus).

Of course, from the Moon&#x27;s near side that same astronomical syzygy was seen as a solar eclipse. Operating in the Mare Crisium on the lunar surface, the Blue Ghost lander captured this video frame of Earth in silhouette around 3:30am CDT, just as the Sun was emerging from behind the terrestrial disk. From Blue Ghost&#x27;s lunar perspective the beautiful diamond ring effect, familiar to earthbound solar eclipse watchers, is striking. Since Earth appears about four times the apparent size of the Sun from the lunar surface the inner solar corona, the atmosphere of the Sun most easily seen from Earth during a total solar eclipse, is hidden from view. Still, scattering in Earth&#x27;s dense atmosphere creates the glowing band of sunlight embracing our fair planet.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/eclipse-shot-from-blue-ghost-mission-1.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Blue Ghost&#x27;s Diamond Ring&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/eclipse-shot-from-blue-ghost-crop1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Hunter Wells&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-03-20&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Recorded from 2024 March 10, to 2025 March 1, this composited series of images reveals a pattern in the seasonal drift of the Sun&#x27;s daily motion through planet Earth&#x27;s sky. Known to some as an analemma, the figure-eight curve was captured in exposures taken on the indicated dates only at 18:38 UTC from the exact same location south of Stephenville, Texas. The Sun&#x27;s position on the 2024 solstice dates of June 20 and December 21 would be at the top and bottom of the curve and correspond to the astronomical beginning of summer and winter in the north. Points that lie along the curve half-way between the solstices would mark the equinoxes. The 2024 equinox on September 22, and in 2025 the equinox on March 20 (today) are the start of northern fall and spring. And since one of the exposures was made on 2024 April 8 from the Stephenville location at 18:38:40 UTC, this analemma project also reveals the solar corona in planet Earth&#x27;s sky during a total solar eclipse.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/HunterWells_submission3-3.png&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Solar Eclipse Analemma Project&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/HunterWells_submission3-3labelled1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Rabeea Alkuwari&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-03-21&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;This popular group leaps into the early evening sky around the March equinox and the northern hemisphere spring.  Famous as the Leo Triplet, the three magnificent galaxies found in the prominent constellation Leo gather here in one astronomical field of view. Crowd pleasers when imaged with even modest telescopes, they can be introduced individually as NGC 3628 (bottom left), M66 (middle right), and M65 (top center). All three are large spiral galaxies but tend to look dissimilar, because their galactic disks are tilted at different angles to our line of sight. NGC 3628, also known as the Hamburger Galaxy, is temptingly seen edge-on, with obscuring dust lanes cutting across its puffy galactic plane. The disks of M66 and M65 are both inclined enough to show off their spiral structure.  Gravitational interactions between galaxies in the group have left telltale signs, including the tidal tails and warped, inflated disk of NGC 3628 and the drawn out spiral arms of M66. This gorgeous view of the region spans over 1 degree (two full moons) on the sky.

There&#x27;s no need to consult a Zen master to find out, just listen to the first acoustic recording of laser shots on Mars. On Mars Rover Perseverance mission sol 12 (March 2, 2021) the SuperCam instrument atop the rover&#x27;s mast zapped a rock dubbed Ma&#x27;az 30 times from a range of about 3.1 meters. Its microphone recorded the soft staccato popping sounds of the rapid series of SuperCam laser zaps. Shockwaves created in the thin Martian atmosphere as bits of rock are vaporized by the laser shots make the popping sounds, sounds that offer clues to the physical structure of the target. This SuperCam close-up of the Ma&#x27;az target region is 6 centimeters (2.3 inches) across.

The featured 360-degree panorama, horizontally compressed, was taken in 2017 by the robotic Curiosity rover that explored the red planet. Named Ogunquit Beach after its terrestrial counterpart, evidence shows that at times long ago the area was underwater, while at other times it was at the edge of an ancient lake.  The light peak in the central background is the top of Mount Sharp, the central feature in Gale Crater where Curiosity explored. Portions of the dark sands in the foreground were  scooped up for analysis.  The light colored bedrock is composed of sediment that likely settled at the bottom of the now-dried lakebed.  The featured panorama (interactive version here) was created from over 100 images and seemingly signed by the rover on the lower left.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/OgunquitBeach_Curiosity_8776.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Ancient Ogunquit Beach on Mars&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/OgunquitBeach_Curiosity_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nMauricio Salazar\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-03-24&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;If the full Moon suddenly faded, what would you see? The answer was recorded in a dramatic time lapse video taken during the total lunar eclipse last week from Uruguay. During a total lunar eclipse, the Earth moves between the Moon and the Sun, causing the Moon to fade dramatically. The Moon never gets completely dark, though, since the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere refracts some light. As the featured video begins, the scene may appear to be daytime and sunlit, but actually it is nighttime and lit by the glow of the full Moon. As the Moon becomes eclipsed and fades, background stars become visible. Most spectacularly, the sky surrounding the eclipsed moon suddenly appears to be full of stars and highlighted by the busy plane of our Milky Way Galaxy. Nearly two hours after the eclipse started, the Moon emerged from the Earth&#x27;s shadow and its bright full glare again dominated the sky.&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;other&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;A Total Lunar Eclipse Over Uruguay&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nZixiong Jin\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-03-25&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;What causes a blue band to cross the Moon during a lunar eclipse? The blue band is real but usually quite hard to see. The featured HDR image of last week&#x27;s lunar eclipse, however -- taken from Norman, Oklahoma (USA) -- has been digitally processed to exaggerate  the colors.  The gray color on the upper right of the top lunar image is the Moon&#x27;s natural color, directly illuminated by sunlight. The lower parts of the Moon on all three images are not directly lit by the Sun since it is being eclipsed -- it is in the Earth&#x27;s shadow. It is faintly lit, though, by sunlight that has passed deep through Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. This part of the Moon is red -- and called a blood Moon -- for the same reason that Earth&#x27;s sunsets are red: because air scatters away more blue light than red. The unusual purple-blue band visible on the upper right of the top and middle images is different -- its color is augmented by sunlight that has passed high through Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, where red light is better absorbed by ozone than blue.

Within the nebula, a cluster&#x27;s young, massive stars are powering the pervasive nebular glow. The eye-catching shapes looming in the featured portrait of NGC 281 are sculpted dusty columns and dense Bok globules seen in silhouette, eroded by intense, energetic winds and radiation from the hot cluster stars. If they survive long enough, the dusty structures could also be sites of future star formation. Playfully called the Pacman Nebula because of its overall shape, NGC 281 is about 10,000 light-years away in the constellation Cassiopeia. This sharp composite image was made through narrow-band filters in Spain in mid 2024. It combines emissions from the nebula&#x27;s hydrogen and oxygen atoms to synthesize red, green, and blue colors.

The sharp, detailed telescopic view reveals M81&#x27;s bright yellow nucleus, blue spiral arms, pinkish starforming regions, and sweeping cosmic dust lanes. But some dust lanes actually cut across the galactic disk (left of center), contrary to other prominent spiral features. The errant dust lanes may be the lingering result of a close encounter between M81 and the nearby galaxy M82 lurking outside of this frame. Scrutiny of variable stars in M81 has yielded a well-determined distance for an external galaxy -- 11.8 million light-years.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/291_lorand_fenyes_m81_kicsi.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Messier 81&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/291_lorand_fenyes_m81_kicsi1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-03-28&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Why is the Moon so dusty? On Earth, rocks are weathered by wind and water, creating soil and sand. On the Moon, eons of constant micrometeorite bombardment have blasted away at the rocky surface creating a layer of powdery lunar soil or regolith.  For the Apollo astronauts and their equipment, the pervasive, fine, gritty dust was definitely a problem. On the lunar surface in December 1972, Apollo 17 astronauts Harrison Schmitt and Eugene Cernan needed to repair one of their rover&#x27;s fenders in an effort to keep the rooster tails of dust away from themselves and their gear. This picture reveals the wheel and fender of their dust covered rover along with the ingenious application of spare maps, clamps, and a grey strip of \&quot;duct tape\&quot;.

Appropriately named, Helene is a Trojan moon, so called because it orbits at a Lagrange point. A Lagrange point is a gravitationally stable position near two massive bodies, in this case Saturn and larger moon Dione. In fact, irregularly shaped ( about 36 by 32 by 30 kilometers) Helene orbits at Dione&#x27;s leading Lagrange point while brotherly ice moon Polydeuces follows at Dione&#x27;s trailing Lagrange point. The sharp stereo anaglyph was constructed from two Cassini images captured during a close flyby in 2011. It shows part of the Saturn-facing hemisphere of Helene mottled with craters and gully-like features.

That happened yesterday over some northern parts of planet Earth as a partial solar eclipse occurred shortly after sunrise. Regions that experienced the Moon blocking part of the Sun included northeastern parts of North America and northwestern parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa.  The featured image was captured yesterday over the Gr\u00e1br\u00f3k volcanic crater in Iceland where much of the Sun became momentarily hidden behind the Moon. The image was taken through a cloudy sky but so well planned that the photographer&#x27;s friend appeared to be pulling the Sun out from behind the Moon. No part of the Earth experienced a total solar eclipse this time. In the distant past, some of humanity was so surprised when an eclipse occurred that ongoing battles suddenly stopped.  Today, eclipses are not a surprise and are predicted with an accuracy of seconds.

Between the emergence of Earth and Mars, Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS appears with a distinctive tail.  The continuous fleeting streaks are high energy particles from the Sun impacting Parker&#x27;s sideways looking camera.  The featured time-lapse video was taken last year during Encounter 21, Parker&#x27;s 21st close approach to the Sun.

This was just the case a few days ago from Les Escoumins, Quebec, Canada as our Solar System&#x27;s bright central orb rose just as it was being partially eclipsed by the Moon. The featured video shows this unusual double-sunrise in real time and being reflected by the St. Lawrence River. Soon after the initial two spots of light appear over distant clouds, what appears to be bright horns become visible -- which are really just parts of the Sun not being eclipsed. Soon, the entire eclipsed Sun is visible above the horizon.  In all, this broken sunrise took less than two minutes during a partial eclipse that lasted many times longer.   Although the Moon circles the Earth once a month (moon-th), it does not always eclipse the Sun because its tilted orbit usually takes it above or below.

Jupiter&#x27;s main ring was discovered in 1979 by NASA&#x27;s passing Voyager 1 spacecraft, but its origin was then a mystery.  Data from NASA&#x27;s Galileo spacecraft that orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, however, confirmed the hypothesis that this ring was created by meteoroid impacts on small nearby moons.  As a small meteoroid strikes tiny Metis, for example, it will bore into the moon, vaporize, and explode dirt and dust off into a Jovian orbit. The featured image of Jupiter in infrared light by the James Webb Space Telescope shows not only Jupiter and its clouds, but this ring as well. Jupiter&#x27;s Great Red Spot (GRS) -- in comparatively light color on the right, Jupiter&#x27;s large moon Europa -- in the center of diffraction spikes on the left, and Europa&#x27;s shadow -- next to the GRS -- are also visible.

The four prominent galaxies seen in this intriguing telescopic skyscape are one such group, Hickson 44. The galaxy group is about 100 million light-years distant, far beyond the spiky foreground Milky Way stars, toward the constellation Leo. The two spiral galaxies in the center of the image are edge-on NGC 3190 with its distinctive, warped dust lanes, and S-shaped NGC 3187. Along with the bright elliptical, NGC 3193 (above and left) they are also known as Arp 316. The spiral toward the lower right corner is NGC 3185, the 4th member of the Hickson group. Like other galaxies in Hickson groups, these show signs of distortion and enhanced star formation, evidence of a gravitational tug of war that will eventually result in galaxy mergers on a cosmic timescale. The merger process is now understood to be a normal part of the evolution of galaxies, including our own Milky Way. For scale, NGC 3190 is about 75,000 light-years across at the estimated distance of Hickson 44.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/ARP316.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Hickson 44 in Leo&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/ARP316_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Bertrand Kulik&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-04-05&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;In dramatic silhouette against a cloudy daytime sky over Paris, France, gargoyles cast their monstrous gaze outward from the west facade of Notre Dame Cathedral.

Analyses of seismometers left on the moon during the Apollo moon landings reveal a surprising number of moonquakes occurring within 100 kilometers of the surface.   In fact, 62 moonquakes were detected in data recorded between 1972 and 1977.   Many of these moonquakes are not only strong enough to move furniture in a lunar apartment, but the stiff rock of the moon continues to vibrate for many minutes, significantly longer than the softer rock earthquakes on Earth.   The cause of the moonquakes remains unknown, but a leading hypothesis includes tidal gravity from -- and relative heating by -- our Earth. Regardless of the source, future moon dwellings need to be built to withstand the frequent shakings.

The featured image of flocculent spiral galaxy NGC 4414 was taken with the Hubble Space Telescope to help answer this question. Flocculent spirals -- galaxies without well-defined spiral arms -- are a quite common form of galaxy, and NGC 4414 is one of the closest.  Stars and gas near the visible edge of spiral galaxies orbit the center so fast that the gravity from a large amount of unseen dark matter must be present to hold them together.  Understanding the matter and dark matter distribution of NGC 4414 helps humanity calibrate the rest of the galaxy and, by deduction, flocculent spirals in general.  Further, calibrating the distance to NGC 4414 helps  humanity calibrate the cosmological distance scale of the entire  visible universe.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/Ngc4414B_Hubble_1280.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;NGC 4414: A Flocculent Spiral Galaxy&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/Ngc4414B_Hubble_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-04-08&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Sometimes, the Moon visits the Pleiades. Technically, this means that the orbit of our Moon takes it directly in front of the famous Pleiades star cluster, which is far in the distance.  The technical term for the event is an occultation, and the Moon is famous for its rare occultations of all planets and several well-known bright stars. The Moon&#x27;s tilted and precessing orbit makes its occultations of the Seven Sisters star cluster bunchy, with the current epoch starting in 2023 continuing monthly until 2029. After that, though, the next occultation won&#x27;t occur until 2042.

The star system expelling this jet is not visible -- it is off to the lower right.  The complex conical structure featured in this infrared image by the James Webb Space Telescope also includes another jet cataloged as HH 50.  The fast jet particles impact the surrounding interstellar gas and form shock waves that glow prominently in infrared light -- shown here as reddish-brown ridges.  This JWST image also resolved the mystery of the unusual object at HH 49&#x27;s tip: it is a spiral galaxy far in the distance.  The blue center is therefore not one star but many, and the surrounding circular rings are actually spiral arms.

In fact, the group&#x27;s dominant galaxy M81 is near the center of the frame sporting grand spiral arms and a bright yellow core. Also known as Bode&#x27;s galaxy, M81 itself spans some 100,000 light-years. Near the top is cigar-shaped irregular galaxy M82.  The pair have been locked in gravitational combat for a billion years. Gravity from each galaxy has profoundly affected the other during a series of cosmic close encounters.  Their last go-round lasted about 100 million years and likely raised density waves rippling around M81, resulting in massive star forming regions arrayed along M81&#x27;s spiral arms.  M82 was left with violent star forming regions too, and colliding gas clouds so energetic that the galaxy glows in X-rays.  In the next few billion years, their continuing gravitational encounters will result in a merger, and a single galaxy will remain. Another group member, NGC 3077 is below and left of the large spiral M81. Far far away, about 12 million light-years distant the M81 group galaxies are seen toward the northern constellation Ursa Major (the Great Bear).

But the Moon spends nearly as many daylight hours above our horizon, though in bright daytime skies the lunar disk looks pale and can be a little harder to see. Of course in daytime skies the Moon also appears to cycle through its phases, shining by reflected sunlight as it orbits our fair planet. For daytime moonwatchers, the Moon is probably easier to spot when the visible sunlit portion of the lunar disk is large and waxing following first quarter or waning approaching its third quarter phase. And though it might look unusual, a daytime moon is often seen even in urban skies. Captured here in a telephoto snapshot taken on March 12, a waxing daytime Moon is aligned near the edge of a popular observation deck that overlooks New York City&#x27;s borough of Manahattan.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/PlataformaRecorteHorizontalRedes.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Moon Near the Edge&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/PlataformaRecorteHorizontalRedes1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-04-13&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;What created this unusual hole in Mars? Actually, there are numerous holes pictured in this Swiss cheese-like landscape, with all-but-one of them showing a dusty, dark, Martian terrain beneath evaporating, light, carbon dioxide ice.  The most unusual hole is on the upper right, spans about 100 meters, and seems to punch through to a lower level. Why this hole exists and why it is surrounded by a circular crater remains a topic of speculation, although a leading hypothesis is that it was created by a meteor impact.  Holes such as this are of particular interest because they might be portals to lower levels that extend into expansive underground caves. If so, these naturally occurring tunnels are relatively protected from the harsh surface of Mars, making them relatively good candidates to contain Martian life. These pits are therefore also prime targets for possible future spacecraft, robots, and even human interplanetary explorers.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/MarsPit_mro_2628.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;An Unusual Hole in Mars&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/MarsPit_mro_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-04-14&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;What&#x27;s happening at the center of our galaxy? It&#x27;s hard to tell with optical telescopes since visible light is blocked by intervening interstellar dust. In other bands of light, though, such as radio, the galactic center can be imaged and shows itself to be quite an interesting and active place.  The featured picture shows an image of our Milky Way&#x27;s center by the MeerKAT array of 64 radio dishes in South Africa. Spanning four times the angular size of the Moon (2 degrees), the image is impressively vast, deep, and detailed.  Many known sources are shown in clear detail, including many with a prefix of Sgr, since the galactic center is in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius.  In our galaxy&#x27;s center lies Sgr A, found here in the image center, which houses the Milky Way&#x27;s central supermassive black hole.  Other sources in the image are not as well understood, including the Arc, just to the left of Sgr A, and numerous filamentary threads. The inset image shows a small patch recently imaged in infrared light with the James Webb Space Telescope to investigate the effects of magnetic fields on star formation.

For stars like our Sun, the center condenses into a white dwarf while the outer atmosphere is expelled into space to appear as a planetary nebula.  The expelled outer atmosphere of planetary nebula NGC 1514 appears to be a jumble of bubbles -- when seen in visible light.  But the view from the James Webb Space Telescope in infrared, as featured here, confirms a different story: in this light the nebula shows a distinct hourglass shape, which is interpreted as a cylinder seen along a diagonal.  If you look closely at the center of the nebula, you can also see a bright central star that is part of a binary system.  More observations might better reveal how this nebula is evolving and how the central stars are working together to produce the interesting cylinder and bubbles observed.

No one is sure. What is sure is that the Cat&#x27;s Eye Nebula (NGC 6543) is one of the best known planetary nebulae on the sky.  Although haunting symmetries are seen in the bright central region, this image was taken to feature its intricately structured outer halo, which spans over three light-years across.  Planetary nebulae have long been appreciated as a final phase in the life of a Sun-like star. Only recently however, have some planetaries been found to have expansive halos, likely formed from material shrugged off during earlier puzzling episodes in the star&#x27;s evolution. While the planetary nebula phase is thought to last for around 10,000 years, astronomers estimate the age of the outer filamentary portions of the Cat&#x27;s Eye Nebula&#x27;s halo to be 50,000 to 90,000 years.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/CatsEyeWide_Niittee_960.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Halo of the Cat&#x27;s Eye&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/CatsEyeWide_Niittee_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Daniel Adibi&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-04-17&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Galaxies of the Virgo Cluster are scattered across this nearly 4 degree wide telescopic field of view. About 50 million light-years distant, the Virgo Cluster is the closest large galaxy cluster to our own local galaxy group. Prominent here are Virgo&#x27;s bright elliptical galaxies from the Messier catalog, M87 at bottom left, and M86 and M84 near center right. M86 and M84 are recognized as part of Markarian&#x27;s Chain, the visually striking line-up of galaxies on the that runs through the upper portion of this frame. Near the middle of the chain lies an intriguing interacting pair of galaxies, NGC 4438 and NGC 4435, known to some as Markarian&#x27;s Eyes.

Comet SWAN&#x27;s coma, its greenish color a signature of diatomic carbon molecules fluorescing in sunlight, is at lower left in this telescopic image. SWAN&#x27;s faint ion tail extends nearly two degrees toward the upper right across the field of view. The interplanetary scene was captured in clear but moonlit skies from June Lake, California on April 14. Seen against background of stars toward the constellation Andromeda, the comet was then some 10 light-minutes from our fair planet. Now a target for binoculars and small telescopes in northern hemisphere morning skies this comet SWAN is headed for a perihelion, its closest approach to the Sun, on May 1.

The image data was captured during perijove 10. That was Juno&#x27;s December 16, 2017 close encounter with the solar system&#x27;s ruling gas giant.

Visible to the unaided eye, it appears as a small fuzzy patch in the constellation of Orion.  Long exposure, multi-wavelength images like this, however, show the Orion Nebula to be a busy neighborhood of young stars, hot gas, and dark dust.  This digital composite features not only three colors of visible light but four colors of infrared light taken by NASA&#x27;s orbiting Spitzer Space Telescope as well.  The power behind much of the Orion Nebula (M42) is the Trapezium - four of the brightest stars in the nebula.  Many of the filamentary structures visible are actually shock waves - fronts where fast moving material encounters slow moving gas.  The Orion Nebula spans about 40 light years and is located about 1500 light years away in the same spiral arm of our Galaxy as the Sun.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/M42_SpitzerCzernetz_2000.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Orion Nebula in Visible and Infrared&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/M42_SpitzerCzernetz_1080.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-04-21&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Is this one galaxy or two? Although it looks like one, the answer is two. One path to this happening is when a small galaxy collides with a larger galaxy and ends up in the center. But in the featured image, something more rare is going on. Here, the central light-colored elliptical galaxy is much closer than the blue and red-colored spiral galaxy that surrounds it. This can happen when near and far galaxies are exactly aligned, causing the gravity of the near galaxy to pull the light from the far galaxy around it in an effect called gravitational lensing. The featured galaxy double was taken by the Webb Space Telescope and shows a complete Einstein ring, with great detail visible for both galaxies.  Galaxy lenses like this can reveal new information about the mass distribution of the foreground lens and the light distribution of the background source.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/GalaxiesLens_Webb_1146.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Galaxy Lenses Galaxy from Webb&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/GalaxiesLens_Webb_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nRich Addis\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-04-22&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;What&#x27;s different about this Moon? It&#x27;s the terminators. In the featured image, you can&#x27;t directly see any terminator -- the line that divides the light of day from the dark of night. That&#x27;s because the featured image is a digital composite of many near-terminator lunar strips over a full Moon.  Terminator regions show the longest and most prominent shadows -- shadows which, by their contrast and length, allow a flat photograph to appear three-dimensional. The overlay images were taken over two weeks in early April.  Many of the Moon&#x27;s craters stand out because of the shadows they all cast to the right. The image shows in graphic detail that the darker regions known as maria are not just darker than the rest of the Moon -- they are also flatter.

More modestly, slanting down from the upper right and high in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is a bright meteor. The dim band of light across the central diagonal is zodiacal light: sunlight reflected from dust in the inner Solar System. The green glow on the far right is aurora high in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.  The bright zigzagging bright line near the bottom is just a light that was held by the scene-planning astrophotographer.

Seen at the center of the cosmic cloud, the star is a mere 3 to 4 million years old. In another three to four million years the massive star will end its life in a supernova explosion. Spanning around 4 light-years, the nebula itself has a bipolar symmetry. That makes it similar in appearance to more common and familiar planetary nebulae - the gaseous shrouds surrounding dying sun-like stars. Also like many planetary nebulae, NGC 6164 has been found to have an extensive, faint halo, revealed in this deep image of the region. Expanding into the surrounding interstellar medium, the material in the halo is likely from an earlier active phase of the O star. This gorgeous telescopic view is a composite of extensive narrow-band image data, highlighting glowing atomic hydrogen gas in red and oxygen in greenish hues, with broad-band data for the surrounding starfield.

Within the galactic disk, loose streamers of star forming regions lie along the galaxy&#x27;s flocculent spiral arms. But the most striking feature of NGC 5335 is its prominent central bar. Seen in about 30 percent of galaxies, including our Milky Way, bar structures are understood to channel material inward toward the galactic center, fueling star formation. Of course, distant background galaxies are easy to spot, scattered around the sharp Hubble image.

Dubbed the Spirograph Nebula for its resemblance to drawings from a cyclical drawing tool, planetary nebula IC 418 shows patterns that are not well understood. Perhaps they are related to chaotic winds from the variable central star, which changes brightness unpredictably in just a few hours.  By contrast, evidence indicates that only a few million years ago, IC 418 was probably a well-understood star similar to our Sun.  Only a few thousand years ago, IC 418 was probably a common red giant star.  Since running out of nuclear fuel, though, the outer envelope has begun expanding outward leaving a hot remnant core destined to become a white-dwarf star, visible in the image center. The light from the central core excites surrounding atoms in the nebula causing them to glow. IC 418 lies about 2000 light-years away and spans 0.3 light-years across.  This false-color image taken from the Hubble Space Telescope reveals the unusual details.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/Spirograph_Hubble_2119.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;IC 418: The Spirograph Nebula&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/Spirograph_Hubble_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nFrancis Bozon &amp; Cecil Navick\n(AstroA.

The visible interstellar gas and dust, shown in colors of the Hubble palette, is part of the star cluster&#x27;s natal molecular cloud, itself cataloged as Gum 37. Dense streamers of material within the nebula, eroded by stellar winds and radiation, clearly trail away from the energetic young stars.  They are likely sites of ongoing star formation with shapes reminiscent of the Tadpoles of IC 410 -- better known to northern skygazers.

Galileo is credited, in 1610, as the first person to see Saturn&#x27;s rings. Testing out Lipperhey&#x27;s recently co-invented telescope, Galileo did not know what they were and so called them \&quot;ears\&quot;.  The mystery deepened in 1612, when Saturn&#x27;s ears mysteriously disappeared. Today we know exactly what happened: from the perspective of the Earth, Saturn&#x27;s rings had become too thin to see.  The same drama plays out every 15 years because Saturn, like Earth, undergoes tilt-driven seasons. This means that as Saturn goes around the Sun, its equator and rings can tilt noticeably toward the Sun and inner Solar System, making them easily visible, but from other orbital locations will appear almost not at all.

The large, 48 kilometer (30 mile) wide crater Janacek is near the upper left edge. Terrain height is color coded with red regions about 3 kilometers above blue ones. MESSENGER&#x27;S final orbit was predicted to end near the center, with the spacecraft impacting the surface at nearly 4 kilometers per second (over 8,700 miles per hour) and creating a new crater about 16 meters (52 feet) in diameter. The impact on the far side of Mercury was not observed by telescopes, but confirmed when no signal was detected from the spacecraft given time to emerge from behind the planet. Launched in 2004, the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemisty and Ranging spacecraft completed over 4,000 orbits after reaching the Solar System&#x27;s innermost planet in 2011.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/messengerImpactSite_black.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;MESSENGER&#x27;s Last Day on Mercury&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/messengerImpactSite_black600.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-05-02&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;The most massive young star cluster in the Small Magellanic Cloud is NGC 346, embedded in our small satellite galaxy&#x27;s largest star forming region some 210,000 light-years distant. Of course the massive stars of NGC 346 are short lived, but very energetic.  Their winds and radiation sculpt the edges of the region&#x27;s dusty molecular cloud triggering star-formation within. The star forming region also appears to contain a large population of infant stars. A mere 3 to 5 million years old and not yet burning hydrogen in their cores, the infant stars are strewn about the embedded star cluster. This spectacular infrared view of NGC 346 is from the James Webb Space Telescope&#x27;s NIRcam. Emission from atomic hydrogen ionized by the massive stars&#x27; energetic radiation as well as molecular hydrogen and dust in the star-forming molecular cloud is detailed in pink and orange hues. Webb&#x27;s sharp image of the young star-forming region spans 240 light-years at the distance of the Small Magellanic Cloud.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/jwst-ngc346.png&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Young Star Cluster NGC 346&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/jwst-ngc346-800.png&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-05-03&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Like Earth&#x27;s moon, Saturn&#x27;s largest moon Titan is locked in synchronous rotation with its planet. This mosaic of images recorded by the Cassini spacecraft in May of 2012 shows its anti-Saturn side, the side always facing away from the ringed gas giant. The only moon in the solar system with a dense atmosphere, Titan is the only solar system world besides Earth known to have standing bodies of liquid on its surface and an earthlike cycle of liquid rain and evaporation. Its high altitude layer of atmospheric haze is evident in the Cassini view of the 5,000 kilometer diameter moon over Saturn&#x27;s rings and cloud tops. Near center is the dark dune-filled region known as Shangri-La.

If any object made of regular matter spins too fast -- it breaks apart. But a black hole might not be able to break apart -- and its maximum spin rate is really unknown. Theorists usually model rapidly rotating black holes with the Kerr solution to Einstein&#x27;s General Theory of Relativity, which predicts several amazing and unusual things.  Perhaps its most easily testable prediction, though, is that matter entering a maximally rotating black hole should be last seen orbiting at near the speed of light, as seen from far away. This prediction was tested by NASA&#x27;s NuSTAR and ESA&#x27;s XMM satellites by observing the supermassive black hole at the center of spiral galaxy NGC 1365. The near light-speed limit was confirmed by measuring the heating and spectral line broadening of nuclear emissions at the inner edge of the surrounding accretion disk. Pictured here is an artist&#x27;s illustration depicting an accretion disk of normal matter swirling around a black hole, with a jet emanating from the top. Since matter randomly falling into the black hole should not spin up a black hole this much, the NuSTAR and XMM measurements also validate the existence of the  surrounding accretion disk.

Objects in the sky sometimes appear reflected as lines across water \u2014 but why? If the water\u2019s surface is smooth, then reflected objects would appear similarly -- as spots. But if the water is choppy, then there are many places where light from the object can reflect off the water and still come to you -- and so together form, typically, a line. The same effect is frequently seen for the Sun just before sunset and just after sunrise. Pictured about 10 days ago in Ibiza, Spain, images of the rising Moon, Venus (top), and Saturn (right, faint) were captured both directly and in line-reflected forms from the Mediterranean Sea. The other bright object on the right with a water-reflected line is a beacon on a rock to warn passing boats.

Light rays from accretion disks around a pair of orbiting supermassive black holes make their way through the warped space-time produced by extreme gravity in this detailed computer visualization.  The simulated accretion disks have been given different false color schemes, red for the disk surrounding a 200-million-solar-mass black hole, and blue for the disk surrounding a 100-million-solar-mass black hole.  For these masses, though, both accretion disks would actually emit most of their light in the ultraviolet.  The video allows us to see both sides of each black hole at the same time.  Red and blue light originating from both black holes can be seen in the innermost ring of light, called the photon sphere, near their event horizons.  In the past decade, gravitational waves from black hole collisions have actually been detected, although the coalescence of supermassive black holes remains undiscovered.

In the lower right corner, marked by a light central line and surrounded by red glowing gas, is irregular galaxy M82.  This stunning vista shows these two mammoth galaxies locked in gravitational combat, as they have been for the past billion years.   The gravity from each galaxy dramatically affects the other during each hundred-million-year pass.  Last go-round, M82&#x27;s gravity likely raised density waves rippling around M81, resulting in the richness of M81&#x27;s spiral arms.  But M81 left M82 with violent star forming regions and colliding gas clouds so energetic the galaxy glows in X-rays.  This big battle is seen from Earth through the faint glow of an Integrated Flux Nebula, a little studied complex of diffuse gas and dust clouds in our Milky Way Galaxy. In a few billion years, only one galaxy will remain.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/M81M82_CAT_3780.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Galaxy Wars: M81 versus M82&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/M81M82_CAT_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-05-08&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Cataloged as M1, the Crab Nebula is the first on Charles Messier&#x27;s famous list of things which are not comets. In fact, the Crab Nebula is now known to be a supernova remnant, an expanding cloud of debris from the death explosion of a massive star. The violent birth of the Crab was witnessed by astronomers in the year 1054. Roughly 10 light-years across, the nebula is still expanding at a rate of about 1,500 kilometers per second. You can see the expansion by comparing these sharp images from the Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope. The Crab&#x27;s dynamic, fragmented filaments were captured in visible light by Hubble in 2005 and Webb in infrared light in 2023.

Answering this long-standing question was significantly advanced recently with data taken by NASA\u2019s IXPE satellite. X-rays cannot exit a black hole, but they can be created in the energetic environment nearby, in particular by a jet of particles moving outward. By observing X-ray light arriving from near the supermassive black hole at the center of galaxy BL Lac, called a blazar, it was discovered that these X-rays lacked significant polarization, which is expected when created more by energetic electrons than protons. In the featured artistic illustration, a powerful jet is depicted emanating from an orange-colored accretion disk circling the black hole. Understanding highly energetic processes across the universe helps humanity to understand similar processes that occur on or near our Earth.

In fact, visible at the center of the nebula, the central star of NGC 1360 is known to be a binary star system likely consisting of two evolved white dwarf stars, less massive but much hotter than the Sun.  Their intense and otherwise invisible ultraviolet radiation has stripped away electrons from the atoms in their mutually surrounding gaseous shroud.

Slowly drifting across the night sky as it orbits the Earth, the International Space Station (ISS) can be seen as a bright spot about once a month from many locations.  The ISS is then visible only just after sunset or just before sunrise because it shines by reflected sunlight -- once the ISS enters the Earth&#x27;s shadow, it will drop out of sight. The only occasion when the ISS is visible during the day is when it passes right in front of the Sun. Then, it passes so quickly that only cameras taking short exposures can visually freeze the ISS&#x27;s silhouette onto the background Sun.

This image series was later combined with a separate image highlighting the texture of the active Sun which included several Sun&#x27;s prominences around the edge.

Also cataloged as NGC 5055, the majestic island universe is nearly 100,000 light-years across, about the size of our own Milky Way. Its bright core and majestic spiral arms lend the galaxy its popular name, The Sunflower Galaxy. This exceptionally deep exposure also follows faint loops and curling star streams far into the galaxy&#x27;s halo. Extending nearly 180,000 light-years from the galactic center, the star streams are likely remnants of tidally disrupted satellites of M63. Other satellite galaxies of M63 can be spotted in the remarkable wide-field image, including dwarf galaxies, which could contribute to M63&#x27;s star streams in the next few billion years.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/M63_HaLRGB_Apod2048.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Curly Spiral Galaxy M63&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/M63_HaLRGB_Apod1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Massimo Di Fusco&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-05-23&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Most globular star clusters roam the halo of our Milky Way galaxy, but globular cluster NGC 6366 lies close to the galactic plane. About 12,000 light-years away toward the constellation Ophiuchus, the cluster&#x27;s starlight is dimmed and reddened by the Milky Way&#x27;s interstellar dust when viewed from planet Earth. As a result, the stars of NGC 6366 look almost golden in this telescopic scene, especially when seen next to relatively bright, bluish, and nearby star 47 Ophiuchi. Compared to the hundred thousand stars or so gravitationally bound in distant NGC 6366, 47 Oph itself is a binary star system  a mere 100 light-years away. Still, the co-orbiting stars of 47 Oph are too close together to be individually distinguished in the image.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/NGC6366_3500.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;NGC 6366 vs 47 Ophiuchi&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/NGC6366_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-05-24&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Deimos takes 30 hours and 18 minutes to complete one orbit around the Red Planet. That&#x27;s a little more than one Martian day or sol which is about 24 hours and 40 minutes long, so Deimos drifts westward across the Martian sky. About 15 kilometers across at its widest, the smallest of Mars&#x27; two moons is bright though. In fact Deimos is the brightest celestial object in this Martian skyscape captured before sunrise by Perseverance on March 1, the 1,433rd sol of the Mars rover&#x27;s mission. The image is a composed of 16 exposures recorded by one of the rover&#x27;s navigation cameras. The individual exposures were combined into a single image for an enhanced low light view.

NASA&#x27;s Juno spacecraft has now completed over 70 swoops past Jupiter as it moves around its highly elliptical orbit. Pictured from 2017, Jupiter is seen from below where, surprisingly, the horizontal bands that cover most of the planet disappear into swirls and complex patterns.  A line of white oval clouds is visible nearer to the equator.  Impressive results from Juno show that Jupiter&#x27;s weather phenomena can extend deep below its cloud tops, that Jupiter&#x27;s center has a core that is unexpectedly large and soft, and that Jupiter&#x27;s magnetic field varies greatly with location.  Although Juno is scheduled to keep orbiting Jupiter further into 2025, at some time the robotic spacecraft will be maneuvered to plunge into the giant planet.

First, the eight rays that appear to be coming out of the center in the featured infrared image are not real \u2014 they are diffraction spikes caused by the mechanical structure of the Webb space telescope itself. The center of NGC 2566 is bright but not considered unusual, which means that it likely contains a supermassive black hole, although currently not very active. At only 76 million light years away, the light we see from NGC 2566 today left when dinosaurs roamed the Earth. The picturesque galaxy is close enough so that Earthly telescopes, including Webb and Hubble, can resolve the turbulent clouds of gas and dust where stars can form and so allows study of stellar evolution. NGC 2566, similar in size to our Milky Way Galaxy, is notable for its bright central bar and its prominent outer spiral arms.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/NGC2256_Webb_1280.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Spiral Galaxy NGC 2566 from Webb&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/NGC2256_Webb_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nIreneusz Nowak\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-05-27&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Behold one of the most photogenic regions of the night sky, captured impressively.

In general, red emanates from nebulas glowing in the light of excited hydrogen gas, while blue marks interstellar dust preferentially reflecting the light of bright young stars.  Thick dust usually appears dark brown.  Many iconic objects of the night sky appear, including (can you find them?) the bright star Antares, the globular star cluster M4, and the Blue Horsehead nebula.

Constructed from Hubble Space Telescope image data, the stunning scene spans about half a light-year across Herbig-Haro 24 (HH 24), some 1,300 light-years or 400 parsecs away in the stellar nurseries of the Orion B molecular cloud complex. Hidden from direct view, HH 24&#x27;s central protostar is surrounded by cold dust and gas flattened into a rotating accretion disk. As material from the disk falls toward the young stellar object, it heats up. Opposing jets are blasted out along the system&#x27;s rotation axis. Cutting through the region&#x27;s interstellar matter, the narrow, energetic jets produce a series of glowing shock fronts along their path.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/hs-2015-42-a-fullHH24.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Herbig-Haro 24&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/hs-2015-42-a-largeHH241024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Franz Hofmann&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-05-29&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Grand spiral galaxies often seem to get all the attention, flaunting young, bright, blue star clusters and pinkish star forming regions along graceful, symmetric spiral arms.

Seen toward the navigational constellation Sextans, the small galaxy lies some 4.5 million light-years distant. That puts it near the outskirts of the local group of galaxies, that includes the large, massive spirals Andromeda and our own Milky Way.

You can connect the dots and dates with your cursor over the image, but be sure to check out this animation of the Red Planet&#x27;s 2024/25 retrograde motion. Of course Mars didn&#x27;t actually reverse the direction of its orbit. Instead, the apparent backwards motion with respect to the background stars is a reflection of the orbital motion of Earth itself. Retrograde motion can be seen each time Earth overtakes and laps planets orbiting farther from the Sun, the Earth moving more rapidly through its own relatively close-in orbit.  In this case Mars&#x27; apparent eastward motion began to reverse around December 8, when it seemed to linger near open star cluster M44 in Cancer. After wandering back to the west, under Gemini&#x27;s bright stars Castor and Pollux, Mars returned to pose near M44 by early May. At its brightest near opposition on 2025 January 16, Mars was a mere 96 million kilometers away.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/Ma2024-5.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Mars in the Loop&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/Ma2024-5_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Marcella Giulia Pace&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-05-31&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;On May 7, the Sun setting behind a church bell tower was captured in this filtered and manipulated digital skyscape from Ragusa, Sicily, planet Earth.

To try it, find the sunspots of active region AR4079 grouped near the bottom of the blue solar disk. Relax and stare at the dark sunspot group for about 30 seconds, then close your eyes or shift your gaze to a plain white surface. In a moment an afterimage of the sunset should faintly appear.

Although details remain uncertain, it surely has to do with an ongoing battle with its smaller galactic neighbor. The featured galaxy is labelled UGC 1810 by itself, but together with its collisional partner is known as Arp 273. The overall shape of UGC 1810 -- in particular its blue outer ring -- is likely a result of wild and violent gravitational interactions. This ring&#x27;s blue color is caused by massive stars that are blue hot and have formed only in the past few million years.  The inner galaxy appears older, redder, and threaded with cool filamentary dust.  A few bright stars appear well in the foreground, unrelated to UGC 1810, while several galaxies are visible well in the background.  Arp 273 lies about 300 million light years away toward the constellation of Andromeda.  Quite likely, UGC 1810 will devour its galactic sidekick over the next billion years and settle into a classic spiral form.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/Arp273Main_HubblePestana_3079.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;UGC 1810: Wildly Interacting Galaxy from Hubble&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/Arp273Main_HubblePestana_1080.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nAbdullah Alharbi\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-02&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Wisps like this are all that remain visible of a Milky Way star.  About 7,000 years ago that star exploded in a supernova, leaving the Veil Nebula.  At the time, the expanding cloud was likely as bright as a crescent Moon, remaining visible for weeks to people living at the dawn of recorded history.  Today, the resulting supernova remnant, also known as the Cygnus Loop, has faded and is now visible only through a small telescope directed toward the constellation of the Swan (Cygnus).  The remaining Veil Nebula is physically huge, however, and even though it lies about 1,400 light-years distant, it covers over five times the size of the full Moon.  The featured picture was taken in Kuwait in mid-2024 and features light emitted by hydrogen in red and oxygen in blue.  In deep images of the complete Veil Nebula like this, even studious readers might not be able to identify the iconic filaments.

Airglow.  Now, air glows all of the time, but it is usually hard to see. A disturbance however -- like an approaching storm -- may cause noticeable rippling in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. These gravity waves are oscillations in air analogous to those created when a rock is thrown in calm water.  The long-duration exposure nearly along the vertical walls of airglow likely made the undulating structure particularly visible.  OK, but where do the colors originate?  The deep red glow likely originates from OH molecules about 87 kilometers high, excited by ultraviolet light from the Sun. The orange and green airglow is likely caused by sodium and oxygen atoms slightly higher up.  The featured image was captured during a climb up Mount Pico in the Azores of Portugal.  Ground lights originate from the island of Faial in the Atlantic Ocean.  A spectacular sky is visible through this banded airglow, with the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy running up the image center, and M31, the Andromeda Galaxy, visible near the top left.

No -- the night sky changes every night in many ways. To better explore how the night sky changes, the USA&#x27;s NSF and DOE commissioned the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Cerro Pach\u00f3n, Chile. In final testing before routine operations, Rubin will begin to explore these nightly changes -- slight differences that can tell us much about our amazing universe and its surprising zoo of objects. With a mirror over 8 meters across, Rubin will continually reimage the entire visible sky every few nights to discover new supernovas, potentially dangerous asteroids, faint comets, and variable stars -- as well as mapping out the visible universe&#x27;s large-scale structure.

Likely not \u2014 because this is a discovery image.  Massive stars forge heavy elements in their cores and, after a few million years, end their lives in powerful supernova explosions. These remnants cool relatively quickly and fade, making them difficult to detect.  To uncover such faint, previously unknown supernova remnants, a dedicated group of amateur astrophotographers searched through sky surveys for possible supernova remnant candidates.  The result: the first-ever image of supernova remnant G115.5+9.1 \u2014 named Scylla by its discoverers\u2014glowing faintly in the constellation of the mythological King of Aethiopia: Cepheus.

Surprisingly, another discovery lurked to the upper right: a faint, previously unknown planetary nebula candidate.

A reason to think so involves  long features -- some dubbed tiger stripes -- that are known to be spewing ice from the moon&#x27;s icy interior into space. These surface cracks create clouds of fine ice particles over the moon&#x27;s South Pole and create  Saturn&#x27;s mysterious E-ring.  Evidence for this has come from the robot Cassini spacecraft that orbited Saturn from 2004 to 2017.  Pictured here, a high resolution image of Enceladus is shown in true color from a close flyby.  The deep crevasses are partly shadowed.  Why Enceladus is active remains a mystery, as the neighboring moon Mimas, approximately the same size, appears quite dead. An analysis of ejected ice grains has yielded evidence that complex organic molecules exist inside Enceladus. These large carbon-rich molecules bolster -- but do not prove -- that oceans under Enceladus&#x27; surface could contain life.

It&#x27;s likely that you do, even though some bright stars have names so old they date back to near the beginning of written language. Many world cultures have their own names for the brightest stars, and it is culturally and historically important to remember them.  In the interest of clear global communication, however, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) has begun to designate standardized star names.  Featured here in true color are the 25 brightest stars in the night sky, currently as seen by humans, coupled with their IAU-recognized names. Some star names have interesting meanings, including Sirius (\&quot;the scorcher\&quot; in Latin), Vega (\&quot;falling\&quot; in Arabic), and Antares (\&quot;rival to Mars\&quot; in Greek). You are likely even familiar with the name of at least one star too dim to make this list: Polaris.

When viewed along a narrow path that mostly avoided landfall, the Moon in silhouette created a hybrid solar eclipse. Hybrid eclipses are rare and can be seen as a total eclipse or an annular \&quot;ring of fire\&quot; eclipse depending on the observer&#x27;s position. Viewers of this much anticipated hybrid event were able to witness a total solar eclipse while anchored in the Indian Ocean near the centerline of the eclipse track off the coast of western Australia. This ship-borne image from renowned eclipse chaser Fred Espenak captured the eclipsed Sun&#x27;s magnificent outer atmosphere, or solar corona, streaming into space. The composite of 11 exposures ranging from 1/2000 to 1/2 second, taken during the 62 seconds of totality, records an extended range of brightness to follow alluring details of the corona not quite visible to the eye.

For comparison, two images of our common star were taken at sunset, one from Earth and one from Mars. These images were scaled to have the same angular width and are featured here side-by-side. A quick inspection will reveal that the Sun appears slightly smaller from Mars than from Earth. This makes sense since Mars is 50% further from the Sun than Earth. More striking, perhaps, is that the Martian sunset is noticeably bluer near the Sun than the typically orange colors near the setting Sun from Earth. The reason for the blue hues from Mars is not fully understood, but thought to be related to forward scattering properties of Martian dust. The terrestrial sunset was taken in 2012 March from Marseille, France, while the Martian sunset was captured in 2015 by NASA&#x27;s robotic Curiosity rover from Gale crater on Mars.

The red flowery-looking nebula just above the image center may seem a good choice, but that&#x27;s not it.  The famous Rosette Nebula is really located on the lower right, here colored blue and white, and connected to the other nebulas by gold-colored filaments.  Because the featured image of Rosette&#x27;s field is so wide, and because of its deep red exposure, it seems to contain other flowers.  Designated NGC 2237, the center of the Rosette Nebula is populated by the bright blue stars of open cluster NGC 2244, whose winds and energetic light are evacuating the nebula&#x27;s center.  The Rosette Nebula is about 5,000 light years distant and, just by itself, spans about three times the diameter of a full moon.

In contrast, the duration of the transit of the ISS across the entire Moon was about half a second.  A close inspection of this unusually crisp ISS silhouette will reveal the outlines of numerous solar panels and trusses.  The bright crater Tycho is visible on the lower left, as well as comparatively rough, light colored terrain known as highlands and relatively smooth, dark colored areas known as maria.

Relatively bright in planet Earth&#x27;s sky, NGC 3521 is easily visible in small telescopes but often overlooked by amateur imagers in favor of other Leo spiral galaxies, like M66 and M65. It&#x27;s hard to overlook in this colorful cosmic portrait though. Spanning some 50,000 light-years the galaxy sports characteristic patchy, irregular spiral arms laced with dust, pink star forming regions, and clusters of young, blue stars. The deep image also finds NGC 3521 embedded in fainter, gigantic, bubble-like shells. The shells are likely tidal debris, streams of stars torn from satellite galaxies that have undergone mergers with NGC 3521 in the distant past.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/NGC3521-2048.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;NGC 3521: Galaxy in a Bubble&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/NGC3521-1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Luca Vanzella&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-20&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;dmonton, Alberta, Canada, planet Earth lies on the horizon in this stack of panoramic composite images. In a monthly time series arranged vertically top to bottom the ambitious photographic project follows the annual north-south swing of sunrise points, from June solstice to December solstice and back again. It also follows the corresponding, but definitely harder to track, Full Moon rise. Of course, the north-south swing of moonrise runs opposite sunrise along the horizon. But these rising Full Moons also span a wider range on the horizon than the sunrises. That&#x27;s because the well-planned project (as shown in this video) covers the period June 2024 to June 2025, centered on a major lunar standstill. Major lunar standstills represent extremes in the north-south range of moonrise driven by the 18.6 year precession period of the lunar orbit.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/MajorLunarStandstillAPOD.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Major Lunar Standstill 2024-2025&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/MajorLunarStandstillAPOD_1200.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Tunc Tezel&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-21&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Sure, that figure-8 shaped curve you get when you mark the position of the Sun in Earth&#x27;s sky at the same time each day over one year is called an analemma. On the left, Earth&#x27;s figure-8 analemma was traced by combining wide-angle digital images recorded during the year from December 2011 through December 2012. But the shape of an analemma depends on the eccentricity of a planet&#x27;s orbit and the tilt of its axis of rotation, so analemma curves can look different for different worlds. Take Mars for example. The Red Planet&#x27;s axial tilt is similar to Earth&#x27;s, but its orbit around the same sun is more eccentric (less circular) than Earth&#x27;s orbit. As seen from the Martian surface, the analemma traced in the right hand panel is shaped more like a tear drop. The Mars rover Opportunity captured the images used over the Martian year corresponding to Earth dates July 2006 to June 2008. Of course, each world&#x27;s solstice dates still lie at the top and bottom of their different analemma curves. The last Mars northern summer solstice was May 29, 2025. Our fair planet&#x27;s 2025 northern summer solstice is at June 21, 2:42 UTC.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/AnalemmaEarthMars.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Two Worlds, Two Analemmas&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/AnalemmaEarthMars1200.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-22&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;How were these unusual Martian spherules created?  Thousands of unusual gray spherules made of iron and rock and dubbed blueberries were found embedded in and surrounding rocks near the landing site of the robot Opportunity rover on Mars in 2004.  To help investigate their origin, Opportunity found a surface dubbed the Berry Bowl with an indentation that was rich in the Martian orbs.  The Berry Bowl is pictured here, imaged during rover&#x27;s 48th Martian day.  The average size of a Martian blueberry rock is only about 4 millimeters across.  By analyzing a circular patch in the rock surface to the left of the densest patch of spherules, Opportunity obtained data showing that the underlying rock has a much different composition than the hematite rich blueberries.  This information contributes to the growing consensus that these small, strange, gray orbs were slowly deposited from a bath of dirty water.

Images of the star forming region W5 like those in the infrared by NASA&#x27;s Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE, later NEOWISE) satellite provide clear clues with indications that massive stars near the center of empty cavities are older than stars near the edges.  A likely reason for this is that the older stars in the center are actually triggering the formation of the younger edge stars.  The triggered star formation occurs when hot outflowing gas compresses cooler gas into knots dense enough to gravitationally contract into stars.  In the featured scientifically colored infrared image, spectacular pillars left slowly evaporating from the hot outflowing gas provide further visual clues. W5 is also known as Westerhout 5 (W5) and IC 1848.  Together with IC 1805, the nebulas form a complex region of star formation popularly dubbed the Heart and Soul Nebulas. The featured image highlights a part of W5 spanning about 2,000 light years that is rich in star forming pillars.  W5 lies about 6,500 light years away toward the constellation of Cassiopeia.

A mere 55 million light-years away in the Virgo Cluster of Galaxies, M61 is also known as NGC 4303.  It&#x27;s considered to be an example of a barred spiral galaxy similar to our own Milky Way.  Like other spiral galaxies, M61 also features sweeping spiral arms, cosmic dust lanes, pinkish star forming regions, and young blue star clusters.

An expansive star-forming region over a hundred light-years across, Messier 8 is also known as the Lagoon Nebula. About 4,000 light-years away the Lagoon Nebula harbors a remarkable cluster of young, massive stars. Their intense radiation and stellar winds energize and agitate this cosmic lagoon&#x27;s turbulent depths. Messier 20&#x27;s popular moniker is the Trifid. Divided into three parts by dark interstellar dust lanes, the Trifid Nebula&#x27;s glowing hydrogen gas creates its dominant red color. But contrasting blue hues in the colorful Trifid are due to dust reflected starlight.

Surprisingly, the rough and battered surface of the farside looks very different from the nearside covered with smooth dark lunar maria.  A likely explanation is that the farside crust is thicker, making it harder for molten material from the interior to flow to the surface and form dark, smooth maria.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/farside_lro1600.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Lunar Farside&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/farside_lro800.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-29&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Are these trees growing on Mars? No.  Groups of dark brown streaks have been photographed by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter on melting pinkish sand dunes covered with light frost. The featured image was taken in 2008 April near the North Pole of Mars. At that time, dark sand on the interior of Martian sand dunes became more and more visible as the spring Sun melted the lighter carbon dioxide ice.  When occurring near the top of a dune, dark sand may cascade down the dune leaving dark surface streaks -- streaks that might appear at first to be trees standing in front of the lighter regions but cast no shadows. Objects about 25 centimeters across are resolved on this image spanning about one kilometer. Close ups of some parts of this image show billowing plumes indicating that the sand slides were occurring even while the image was being taken.

What appears to be a giant cosmic umbrella is now known to be a tidal stream of stars stripped from a small satellite galaxy. The main galaxy, spiral galaxy NGC 4651, is about the size of our Milky Way, while its stellar parasol appears to extend some 100 thousand light-years above this galaxy&#x27;s bright disk. A small galaxy was likely torn apart by repeated encounters as it swept back and forth on eccentric orbits through NGC 4651. The remaining stars will surely fall back and become part of a combined larger galaxy over the next few million years. The featured deep image was captured in long exposures from Saudi Arabia. The Umbrella Galaxy lies about 50 million light-years distant toward the well-groomed northern constellation of Berenice&#x27;s Hair (Coma Berenices).

No. Capturing this stunning alignment took careful planning: being in the right place at the right time. In the featured image taken in June 2024 from Otago, New Zealand, the bright central core of our Milky Way Galaxy, home to the many of our Galaxy&#x27;s 400 billion stars, can be seen between two picturesque rocks spires.  For observers in Earth&#x27;s Northern Hemisphere, the core is only visible throughout the summer. As Earth orbits the Sun, different parts of the Milky Way become visible at different angles at different times of the night. As Earth rotates, the orientation of the Milky Way in the sky also shifts -- sometimes standing vertically as seen in the featured image, and other times stretching parallel to the horizon, making it harder to see. In early June, observers can watch it emerge low on the horizon after sunset and gradually arc upward to reveal its full grandeur.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/MwSpires_Chay_1874.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Milky Way Through Otago Spires&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/MwSpires_Chay_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nMatipon Tangmatitham \n(NARIT)\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-07-03&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;If you know where to look, you can see a thermonuclear explosion from a white dwarf star.

Similarly, Nova Velorum 2025, toward the southern constellation of the Ship Sails (Vela), was discovered on June 25 and peaked a few days later.  A nova somewhere in our Galaxy becomes briefly visible to the unaided eye only every year or two, so it is quite unusual to have two novas visible simultaneously.

But your unaided eye can also see its nebulosity -- the gas and dust surrounding it -- under dark skies. However, telescopes can catch even more. The bright blue stars of the Pleiades, also known as the Seven Sisters, light up their surrounding dust, causing it to appear a diffuse blue that can only be seen under long exposures.

Planetary nebula Mz3 is being cast off by a star similar to our Sun that is, surely, round.  Why then would the gas that is streaming away create an ant-shaped nebula that is distinctly not round?  Clues might include the high 1000-kilometer per second speed of the expelled gas, the light-year long length of the structure, and the magnetism of the star featured here at the nebula&#x27;s center.  One possible answer is that Mz3 is hiding a second, dimmer star that orbits close in to the bright star.  A competing hypothesis holds that the central star&#x27;s own spin and magnetic field are channeling the gas.

Still, observed properties of NGC 2685 suggest that the rotating helix structure is remarkably old and stable.

The featured image, taken by ESA&#x27;s robotic Mars Express spacecraft currently orbiting Mars, shows great details of the chasm and the unusual horseshoe shaped indentation in the central mesa. Material from the mesa appears to have flowed onto the floor of the chasm, while a possible dark layer appears to have pooled like ink on a downslope landing.

A gathering of 100 stars or so, all around 100 million years young, M6 lies some 1,600 light-years away toward the central Milky Way in the constellation Scorpius. Also cataloged as NGC 6405, the pretty star cluster&#x27;s outline suggests its popular moniker, the Butterfly Cluster. Surrounded by diffuse reddish emission from the region&#x27;s hydrogen gas the cluster&#x27;s mostly hot and therefore blue stars are near the center of this colorful cosmic snapshot. But the brightest cluster member is a cool K-type giant star. Designated BM Scorpii it shines with a yellow-orange hue, seen near the end of one of the butterfly&#x27;s antennae. This telescopic field of view spans nearly 2 Full Moons on the sky. That&#x27;s 25 light-years at the estimated distance of Messier 6.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/M6.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Messier 6&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/M6_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-07-20&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;About 1,300 images from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft&#x27;s wide angle camera were used to compose this spectacular view of a familiar face - the lunar nearside. But why is there a lunar nearside? The Moon rotates on its axis and orbits the Earth at the same rate, about once every 28 days. Tidally locked in this configuration, the synchronous rotation always keeps one side, the nearside, facing Earth. As a result, featured in remarkable detail in the full resolution mosaic, the smooth, dark, lunar maria (actually lava-flooded impact basins), and rugged highlands, are well-known to earthbound skygazers. To find your favorite mare or large crater, just follow this link or slide your cursor over the picture. The LRO images used to construct the mosaic were recorded over a two week period in December 2010.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1103/lroc_wac_nearside.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Lunar Nearside&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/lroc_wac_nearside800.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-07-21&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Nebulas are perhaps as famous for being identified with familiar shapes as perhaps cats are for getting into trouble.  Still, no known cat could have created the vast Cat&#x27;s Paw Nebula visible toward the constellation of the Scorpion  (Scorpius).  At 5,700 light years distant, Cat&#x27;s Paw is an emission nebula within a larger molecular cloud.  Alternatively known as the Bear Claw Nebula and cataloged as NGC 6334, stars nearly ten times the mass of our Sun have been born there in only the past few million years. Pictured here is a recently released image of the Cat&#x27;s Paw taken in infrared light by the James Webb Space Telescope.

Yes, when the first explosion acts like a detonator for the second. This is a leading hypothesis for the cause of supernova remnant (SNR) 0509-67.5.  In this two-star system, gravity causes the larger and fluffier star to give up mass to a smaller and denser white dwarf companion. Eventually the white dwarf&#x27;s near-surface temperature goes so high that it explodes, creating a shock wave that goes both out and in -- and so triggers a full Type Ia supernova near the center. Recent images of the SNR 0509-67.5 system, like the featured image from the Very Large Telescope in Chile, show two shells with radii and compositions consistent with the double detonation hypothesis. This system, SNR 0509-67.5 is also famous for two standing mysteries: why its bright supernova wasn&#x27;t noted 400 years ago, and why no visible companion star remains.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/DoubleSN_ESO_3000.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;A Double Detonation Supernova&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/DoubleSN_ESO_1080.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nJason Rice\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-07-23&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Have you ever seen a fireball?  In astronomy, a fireball is a very bright meteor -- one at least as bright as Venus and possibly brighter than even a full Moon. Fireballs are rare -- if you see one you are likely to remember it for your whole life.  Physically, a fireball is a small rock that originated from an asteroid or comet that typically leaves a fading smoke trail of gas and dust as it shoots through the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.  It is unlikely that any single large ground strike occurred -- much of the rock likely vaporized as it broke up into many small pieces.

As the bright, beautiful ring system grows narrower and fainter it becomes increasingly difficult to see for denizens of planet Earth. But it does provide the opportunity to watch transits of Saturn&#x27;s moons and their dark shadows across the ringed gas giant&#x27;s still bright disk. Of course Saturn&#x27;s largest moon Titan is the easiest to spot in transit. In this telescopic snapshot from July 18, Titan itself is at the upper left, casting a round dark shadow on Saturn&#x27;s banded cloudtops above the narrow rings. In fact Titan&#x27;s transit season is in full swing now with shadow transits every 16 days corresponding to the moon&#x27;s orbital period. Its final shadow transit will be on October 6, though Titan&#x27;s pale disk will continue to cross in front of Saturn as seen from telescopes on planet Earth every 16 days through January 25, 2026.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/SaturnJuly18_2025TitanShadowTransit1200.png&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Titan Shadow Transit&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/SaturnJuly18_2025TitanShadowTransit1024.png&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Petr Hor\u00e1lek&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-07-25&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Meteors from the Kappa Cygnid meteor shower are captured in this time-lapse composite skyscape. The minor meteor shower, with a radiant not far from its eponymous star Kappa Cygni, peaks in mid-August, almost at the same time as the much better-known and better-observed Perseid meteor shower. But, seen to have a peak rate of only about 3 meteors per hour, Kappa Cygnids are vastly outnumbered by the more popular, prolific Perseid shower&#x27;s meteors that emanate from the heroic constellation Perseus. To capture dozens of Kappa Cygnids, this long term astro-imaging project compiled meteors in exposures selected from over 51 August nights during the years 2012 through 2024. Most of the exposures with identified Kappa Cygnid meteors were made in August 2021, a high point of the shower&#x27;s known 7-year activity cycle. All twelve years worth of Kappa Cygnids are registered against a base sea and night skyscape of the Milky Way above Elafonisi Beach, Crete, Greece, also recorded in August of 2021.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/KCG2021_08_11_Pano_Elafonisi_met_fin-CCMZ_1500px.png&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Twelve Years of Kappa Cygnids&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/KCG2021_08_11_Pano_Elafonisi_met_fin-CCMZ_1024px.png&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Leo Shatz&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-07-26&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Globular star cluster Omega Centauri packs about 10 million stars much older than the Sun into a volume some 150 light-years in diameter. Also known as NGC 5139, at a distance of 15,000 light-years it&#x27;s the largest and brightest of 200 or so known globular clusters that roam the halo of our Milky Way galaxy. Though most star clusters consist of stars with the same age and composition, the enigmatic Omega Cen exhibits the presence of different stellar populations with a spread of ages and chemical abundances. In fact, Omega Cen may be the remnant core of a small galaxy merging with the Milky Way. With a yellowish hue, Omega Centauri&#x27;s red giant stars are easy to pick out in this sharp telescopic view.  A two-decade-long exploration of the dense star cluster with the Hubble Space Telescope has revealed evidence for a massive black hole near the center of Omega Centauri.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/oc_ls_2025.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Globular Cluster Omega Centauri&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/oc_ls_2025_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-07-27&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Have you ever watched a lightning storm in awe?  You&#x27;re not alone. Details of what causes lightning are still being researched, but it is known that inside some clouds, internal updrafts cause collisions between ice and snow that slowly separate charges between cloud tops and bottoms. The rapid electrical discharges that are lightning soon result.  Lightning usually takes a jagged course, rapidly heating a thin column of air to about three times the surface temperature of the Sun.  The resulting shock wave starts supersonically and decays into the loud sound known as thunder.  On average, around the world, about 6,000 lightning bolts occur between clouds and the Earth every minute. Pictured in July 2019 in a two-image composite, lightning stems from communication antennas near the top of Volc\u00e1n de Agua (Volcano of Water) in Guatemala.

In 2022, to develop Earth-saving technology, NASA deliberately crashed the DART spacecraft into the asteroid moonlet Dimorphos. The hope was that this collision would alter the trajectory of Dimorphos around its parent asteroid Didymos and so demonstrate that similar collisions could, in theory, save the Earth from being hit by (other) hazardous asteroids.  But analyses of new results show that the effects of the collision are different than expected -- and we are trying to understand why.  Featured here is the time lapse video taken by the ejected LICIACube camera LUKE showing about 250 seconds of the expanding debris field of Dimorphos after the collision, with un-impacted Didymos passing in the foreground.  In 2026, Europe&#x27;s Hera mission will reach the asteroids and release three spacecraft to better study the matter.&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;other&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Collision at Asteroid Dimorphos&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nGeorge Chatzifrantzis\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-07-29&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Is the Helix Nebula looking at you? No, not in any biological sense, but it does look quite like an eye. The Helix Nebula is so named because it also appears that you are looking down the axis of a helix. In actuality, it is now understood to have a surprisingly complex geometry, including radial filaments and extended outer loops.  The Helix Nebula (aka NGC 7293) is one of brightest and closest examples of a planetary nebula, a gas cloud created at the end of the life of a Sun-like star. The remnant central stellar core, destined to become a white dwarf star, glows in light so energetic it causes the previously expelled gas to fluoresce. The featured picture, taken in red, green, and blue but highlighted by light emitted primarily by hydrogen was created from 12 hours of exposure through a personal telescope located in Greece.

Hot solar plasma jumps off the Sun&#x27;s surface into prominences, with the most common type of prominence being a simple loop.  The loop shape originates from the Sun&#x27;s magnetic field, which is traced by spiraling electrons and protons.  Many loops into the Sun&#x27;s lower corona are large enough to envelop the Earth and are stable enough to last days.  They commonly occur near active regions that also include dark sunspots.  The featured panel shows four loops, each of which was captured near the Sun&#x27;s edge during 2024 and 2025. The images were taken by a personal telescope in Mantova, Italy and in a very specific color of light emitted primarily by hydrogen. Some solar prominences suddenly break open and eject particles into the Solar System, setting up a space weather sequence that can affect the skies and wires of Earth.

Presently the brightest supernova in planet Earth&#x27;s sky, 2025rbs is a Type Ia supernova, likely caused by the thermonuclear detonation of a white dwarf star that accreted material from a companion in a binary star system.  Type Ia supernovae are used as standard candles to establish the distance scale of the universe. The host galaxy of 2025rbs is NGC 7331.

About 7,000 light-years distant and filled with glowing gas and an embedded cluster of young stars, the region is known as M16 or the Eagle Nebula. Hubble&#x27;s iconic images of the Eagle Nebula include the famous star-forming Pillars of Creation, towering structures of interstellar gas and dust 4 to 5 light-years long. But this small dark nebula, known to some as a Bok globule, is a fraction of a light-year across. The Bok globule stands out in silhouette against the expansive background of M16&#x27;s diffuse glow.

Multiple firefly flashes streak across the foreground as the luminous Milky Way arcs above the horizon in the Sierra de \u00d3rganos national park of central Mexico. The collection of bright streaks aligned across the sky toward the upper left in the timelapse image are Delta Aquariid meteors. Currently active, the annual Delta Aquariid meteor shower shares August nights though, overlapping with the better-known Perseid meteor shower. This year that makes post-midnight, mostly moonless skies in early August very popular with late night skygazers. How can you tell a Delta Aquariid from a Perseid meteor?  The streaks of Perseid meteors can be traced back to an apparent radiant in the constellation Perseus. Delta Aquariids appear to emerge from the more southerly constellation Aquarius, beyond the top left of this frame. Of course, the bioluminescent flashes of fireflies are common too on these northern summer nights. But how can you tell a firefly from a meteor?

Grains of icy rock will streak across the sky as they evaporate during entry into Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.  These grains were shed from Comet Swift-Tuttle.  The Perseids result from the annual crossing of the Earth through Comet Swift-Tuttle&#x27;s orbit, and are typically the most active meteor shower of the year.  Although it is hard to predict the level of activity in any meteor shower, in a clear dark sky an observer might see a meteor a minute.  This year&#x27;s Perseids peak just a few days after  full moon, and so some faint meteors will be lost to the lunar skyglow.  Meteor showers in general are best seen from a relaxing position, away from lights.

Now, over 550 hours of combined exposure and a collaboration between amateur and professional astronomers has revealed strong evidence for their true nature: SDSO 1 is not intergalactic, but a new class of planetary nebula within our galaxy.  Dubbed a Ghost Planetary Nebula (GPN), SDSO 1 is the first recognized member of a new subclass of faded planetary nebulas, along with seven others also recently identified.

Discovered in 2022 by amateur astronomers, the faint arcs -- dubbed SDSO 1 -- span nearly the same angular size as M31 itself.  At first, their origin was a mystery: are they actually near the Andromeda Galaxy, or alternatively near to our Sun?  Now, over 550 hours of combined exposure and a collaboration between amateur and professional astronomers has revealed strong evidence for their true nature: SDSO 1 is not intergalactic, but a new class of planetary nebula within our galaxy.  Dubbed a Ghost Planetary Nebula (GPN), SDSO 1 is the first recognized member of a new subclass of faded planetary nebulas, along with seven others also recently identified.  Shown in blue are extremely faint oxygen emission from the shock waves, while the surrounding red is a hydrogen-emitting trail that indicates the GPN&#x27;s age.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2508/M31Oxy_Collab_5415.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Blue Arcs Toward Andromeda&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2508/M31Oxy_Collab_960.jpg&quot;}
